<h1>THE YELLOW HORDE</h1>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_I" id="CHAPTER_I"></a>CHAPTER I</h2>


<p>The wolfer lay in his cabin and listened to
the first few night sounds of the foothills.
The clear piping notes of migrating plover
floated softly down to him, punctuated by
the rasping cry of a nighthawk. A coyote
raised his voice, a perfect tenor note that
swept up to a wild soprano, then fell again in
a whirl of howls which carried amazing shifts
of inflection, tearing up and down the coyote
scale. One after another added his voice to
the chorus until it seemed that the swelling
volume could be produced by no less than a
full thousand musical prairie wolves scattered
through the foothills for a score of miles.</p>

<p>Wild music to the ears of most men, the
song of flat wastes and deserts and limitless<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">2</a></span>
horizons, freighted with a loneliness which
is communicated to man in a positive ache
for companionship,&mdash;and which carries a
wealth of companionship in itself for those
who have lived so long under the open skies
that the song of the desert choir comes to
them as a lullaby.</p>

<p>It moved Collins, the wolfer, to quiet mirth.
Always it affected him that way, this first
clamorous outburst of the night. He read
in it a note of deep-seated humor, the jeering
laughter of the whole coyote tribe mocking
the world of men who had sworn to exterminate
their kind.</p>

<p>"The little devils!" Collins chuckled.
"The little yellow devils! Men can't wipe
'em out. There'll be a million coyotes left
to howl when the last man dies."</p>

<p>From this oft-repeated prophecy Collins
was known to every stockman in three States
as the Coyote Prophet, the title a jeering one
at first, then bestowed with increasing respect<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">3</a></span>
as men saw many of his prophecies fulfilled.
The coyote's larger cousin, the wolf, ranged the
continent over while the coyote himself was
strictly a prairie dweller. For twenty years
Collins had predicted that wolves would disappear
in settled districts while the coyote
would survive; not only survive but increase
his range to include the hills and spread over
the continent from the Arctic to the Gulf.
There were rumors of coyotes turning up in
Indiana. Then came the tale that a strange
breed of small yellow wolves had appeared
in Michigan. Those sheepmen who summered
their sheep in the high valleys of the
western mountains complained that stray
coyotes quit the flats and followed them
into the hills to prey upon the flocks. The
buffalo wolves that had once infested the
range country were gone and it was seldom
that any of the big gray killers turned up on
the open range except when the pinch of cold
and famine drove a few timber wolves down<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">4</a></span>
from the north. Men saw these things and
wondered if all of Collins' sweeping prophecies
would come to pass. In the face of conditions
that had placed a value on the coyote's pelt
and a bounty on his scalp, there was no apparent
decrease in the numbers of the yellow
horde from year to year.</p>

<p>Collins listened to the coyote clamor and
knew that they had come to stay. The concert
was suddenly hushed as a long-drawn
wolf howl, faint from distance, drifted far
out across the range. Collins turned in his
blankets and peered through the window at
the black bulk of the mountains to the north
of him, towering clear and distinct in the
brilliant moonlight.</p>

<p>"If you come down out of those hills I'll
stretch your pelt," the wolfer stated. "I'll
pinch your toes in a number four."</p>

<p>The wolf whose howl had occasioned this
assertion was even then considering the
possibilities of which Collins spoke. Men<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">5</a></span>
called those of his kind breed-wolves, half
coyote and half wolf. He stood on the high
divide which was the roughly separating line
between the haunts of the two tribes whose
blood flowed in his veins,&mdash;all wolf except
for the yellow fur that marked him for a breed.
The coyote voices lifted to him and Breed read
them as the call of kind; for although he had
spent the past ten months with the wolf tribe
of his father his first friendships had been
formed among his mother's people on the open
range. The acrid spice of the sage drifted
to his nostrils and combined with the coyote
voices to fill him with a homesick urge to
revisit the land of his birth.</p>

<p>But he would not go down. Breed knew
well the dangers of the open range; the
devilish riders who made life one long gamble
for every wolf that appeared; he had gruesome
recollections of the many coyotes he had
seen in traps. But those things gave him
small concern. It was still another menace&mdash;the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">6</a></span>
poison baits put out by wolfers&mdash;which
held him back. Not that he feared poison
for himself, but coyotes writhing in convulsions
and frothing at the mouth had always
filled him with a terrible dread. It was an
epidemic of this sort which had driven him
to leave the sagebrush land of the coyotes for
the heavily timbered country of the wolves.
The memory of it lingered with him now.
Would he find these stricken, demented
creatures there?</p>

<p>Breed moved down the south slope of the
hills at last, the sage scent luring the coyote
in him, but moved slowly and with many
halts occasioned by the wolf suspicion which
urged him to turn back. When dawn lifted
the shadows from the low country, Breed was
prowling along the first rim of the hills.</p>

<p>Two dirt-roofed log cabins showed as toy
houses, small from distance, and he could
see the slender threads of smoke ascending
from others, the houses themselves beyond<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">7</a></span>
the scope of his vision. The range was taking
on fall shades, the gray of the sage relieved
by brown patches of open grasslands and
splotches of color where early frosts had
touched the birch and willow thickets that
marked each side-hill spring. Tiny dark
specks moved through it all. Meat! It had
been long since Breed had tasted beef, and
his red tongue lolled out and dripped in anticipation
of the coming feast.</p>

<p>But he would not go down until night.
Twice during the early evening Breed howled,
and Collins, down in the choppy country
below, turned his glasses toward the spot to
see what manner of wolf this was who howled
in the broad light of day. The second time
he located Breed. The yellow wolf stood on
the rims half a mile above, looming almost
life-size in the twelve-power lens. Collins
noted the yellow fur.</p>

<p>"A breed-wolf," he said. "The most cunning
devil that ever made a track. He'll<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">8</a></span>
never take on a feed of poison bait or plant
his foot on a trap pan. He'll come down&mdash;and
I'll ride him out on the first tracking
snow."</p>

<p>Just at dusk Breed howled again and
dropped down to the broken country at the
base of the hills, skirting the flats and holding
to the roughest brakes, then swung out across
the rolling foothills.</p>

<p>The wind soon brought him the message
that coyotes were just ahead and he traced
the scent upwind, anxious for the first sight
of his former running mates. Two coyotes
scattered swiftly before his approach, each
carrying his own piece of a jack rabbit which
the pair had caught and torn apart. Breed
did not follow but held steadily on in search
of more. The urge for companionship was
even stronger than hunger, and he sought to
satisfy the stronger craving first. Twice
more he veered into the wind, and both times
the coyotes slipped away as he advanced.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">9</a></span>
He followed the line of one's retreat and the
coyote whirled and fled like a yellow streak
in the moonlight. Breed was puzzled by all
this, but the craving for food had grown so
strong as to crowd out all else, and he abandoned
the hunt for friends to hunt for meat
instead.</p>

<p>Out in the center of a broad flat bench a
mile across Breed made out a group of slowly
moving specks which he knew for cows, and
he headed toward them, taking advantage of
the cover afforded by every clump of sage as
he crept up to a yearling steer that lagged
behind the rest. He had hunted heavy game
animals with the wolves, animals with every
sense alert to detect the approach of the big
gray killers, and he fully expected the steer
to break into full flight at the first warning
of his presence. He had almost forgotten
the stupidity of the cows on the open range
and the ease with which he had torn them
down when hunting them with his wolf father<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">10</a></span>
long before. He made his final rush and
drove his teeth deep into one hind leg before
his prey had even quickened his gait. The
steer lurched into an awkward gallop and
bawled with fright as the savage teeth cut
through muscles and hide. Breed lunged
for the same spot again; once more and the
leg was useless, the hamstrings cut, and it
sagged loosely with every step. He slashed
at the other leg. Within a hundred yards of
the start the steer pitched down, bracing his
foreparts off the ground with his two front
feet, and even as he fell the yellow wolf drove
for his throat.</p>

<p>Then Breed circled his kill, looking off in
all directions to make sure that there was no
route by which men might approach unseen.
He stretched forth his head and cupped his
lips as he sent his tribal call rolling across the
range, the message that here was meat for all
of his kind who would come and feed. A score
of coyote voices answered from far and near.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">11</a></span></p>

<p>Collins heard the dread cry and knew that
the wolf had made a kill. He knew too that
whenever the wolf note was heard, all other
sounds were stilled as if every living creature
expected to hear an answering cry and waited
for it to come before resuming their own
communications. The fact that the coyotes
answered the cry assured Collins that it was
the breed-wolf that had howled; that coyote
ears had read a note of their own kind in the
sound, a note which even his experienced ears
could not detect.</p>

<p>The yellow wolf tore at the warm meat and
waited,&mdash;waited for his coyote kinsmen to
join him at the feast. He howled again and
they answered, reading invitation to coyote
as well as to wolf in the sound, but they would
not come in. An old dog coyote trotted up
and down the crest of a slight rise of ground
two hundred yards downwind. Another
joined him, then a third, and in less than an
hour there was a half score of coyotes circling<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">12</a></span>
the spot. Breed could see dim shapes moving
across the open places and padding on silent
feet over the cow trails that threaded the sage.
Surely they would come in. The shadowy
forms were restless, never still, and prowled
round and round him, but they would not
join him at the kill.</p>

<p>Breed was mystified by this strange thing.
Here was meat yet the meat-eaters would not
come in and feed. Coyotes had fed with
him long ago but shunned him now. Breed
could not know that then he had been accepted
as one of them, having grown to
maturity among them and so become known
to every coyote on his range; that they had
forgotten him as an individual, as he had also
forgotten them. If there were any old friends
among those who circled round him now he
did not know them as such, only as a
companionable whole; and they knew him for
a wolf,&mdash;a wolf at least in size and strength.
There was a coyote note in his call but not<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">13</a></span>
one of them would venture in to feed with the
great yellow beast that was tearing the steer.</p>

<p>At last a grizzled old dog coyote drew up to
within ten yards. He had lived to the limit
of all experiences which a coyote can pass
through and still survive. He had even
known the crushing grip of a double-spring
trap, a Newhouse four. This misadventure
had occurred in midwinter when the range
was gripped by bitter frost. The cold had
numbed the pain and congealed the flesh to
solid ice. He had cut through the meat with
his keen-pointed teeth, and one desperate
wrench had snapped the frozen bone and freed
him. There were many of his kind so maimed,
and the wolfers, abbreviating the term peg-legs,
called these three-footed ones "pegs."</p>

<p>A second coyote joined Peg near the steer.
He too had lived long and hard. He had
been shot at many times and wounded twice.
A shattered foreleg had healed with an ugly
twist, the foot pointing inside and leaving<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">14</a></span>
only the prints of two warped toe pads when
it touched the ground.</p>

<p>Peg and Cripp circled twice round the steer
at a distance of thirty feet. They had known
other breeds and had found that some would
share their kills. Breed went out to greet
them and they sidled away as he advanced,
stopping when he stopped and turning to face
him. Cripp allowed him to draw close, his
teeth bared in warning against a too effusive
greeting, while Peg drew swiftly in behind the
wolf. The peg-leg coyote stretched forth
his nose for one deep sniff, then sprang ten
feet away as Breed whirled. Cripp drew
up for a similar sniff as Breed faced Peg, then
leaped away as Peg had done. Nature has
endowed the members of each animal tribe
with a different scent, and most animals
identify enemies and friends with nose instead
of eyes. That one deep inhalation had
assured the two coyotes that there was a
strain of their own scent mingled with that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">15</a></span>
of the wolf. They grew bolder and stalked
stiffly about him, appraising his qualities with
eye and nose. When Breed returned to the
feed they followed a few steps behind. At
first they kept the body of the steer between
them, then lost all restraint and accepted
Breed as a brother coyote from whom they
had nothing to fear.</p>

<p>An hour before dawn Breed left the spot
and traveled back to the edge of the hills
where he bedded for the day. He was full
fed and satisfied with life. It was not until
night closed down about him that he was conscious
of the single flaw in his content, the
one thing lacking to complete it all. Breed
loosed the hunting cry but there was no answering
call. He tried again without success.
When with the wolves he had longed for the
smell of the sage, the scent that spoke of
home to him, and the mocking voices of the
coyotes. Now that he had all these he missed
the muster cry of the pack, hungered to hear<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">16</a></span>
the aching wails coming from far across the
timbered hills, penetrating to the farthest
retreats of the antlered tribes and sounding
a warning to all living things that the hunt-pack
was about to take the meat trail. But
he knew that coyotes did not hunt in packs;
that they hunted singly or in pairs, killing
more by stealth than strength; clever stalkers
and the most intelligent team-workers and
relayers in the world, but lacking the weight
and driving force to tear down a steer,&mdash;calves
their largest prey.</p>

<p>Breed howled again and started on the
hunt alone. Even then, though he did not
know it, his pack was gathering to him. The
two wise old coyotes who had fed with him
the night before knew that wherever they
found the big breed-wolf, there they would
also find meat. They had started up at his
first call and Peg was coming swiftly from the
south, Cripp from the west. Breed had not
traveled far before he was aware that other<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">17</a></span>
hunters were abroad and running with him,
swinging wide on either flank. Here was his
pack! At first he was not sure, but whenever
he wheeled or veered from his course the two
coyotes altered their routes to accord with
his. He ran on for miles, thrilled with the
knowledge that his queer pack followed loyally
where he led, and when at last he singled out a
steer the two veteran coyotes angled swiftly in
and ran but a few yards on either side of him.</p>

<p>Then Breed sounded the meat call,&mdash;and
two jeering coyote voices launched into full
cry and howled with him. And Collins, the
Coyote Prophet, for the first time in all his
experience heard wolf and coyote howl in
unison over the same kill.</p>

<p>Every night thereafter Breed's pack of
two ran with him on the hunt and always
there were the dim shapes circling the kill,
padding restlessly through the sage as they
waited for the yellow wolf to leave so they
could swarm in and pick the bones.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">18</a></span></p>

<p>At first Breed had retired to the edge of the
hills to spend his days, but his habits were
changed through long immunity until his
days as well as nights were spent in the open
country; but his caution was never relaxed
and he bedded on the crest of some rise of
ground which afforded a clear field of view for
miles in all directions. He frequently saw
some of the devilish riders and occasionally
one drew uncomfortably near his retreat,
but always veered away before discovering
his presence. His days were untroubled
except by the memories of poisoned coyotes
which persisted in his mind. When he slept
his dreams often reverted to these poisoned
horrors, and their death rattles sounded in his
ears and his feet twitched in imaginary flight
as he sought to put distance between himself
and these haunting demons. Breed knew that
poison was some evil exercised by man, but
its workings were shrouded in mystery.
Traps he could understand,&mdash;and rifle shots;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">19</a></span>
for although this latter force was peculiar,
yet there was sound. He understood only
those things which to him were real and
actual, things communicated through his
physical senses. Poison seemed some sort
of intangible magic, an evil spell wrought by
man, and which transformed sound coyotes
into diseased fiends in the space of seconds.</p>

<p>Always he waked snarling from these
dreams, and always he was vastly puzzled by
the abrupt change from night death scenes
to the daylight calm of the open range. For
dreams too were beyond his comprehension.
They were actual scenes and scents and sounds
to him,&mdash;then vanished. It was only
natural that his greatest waking terror should
stalk through his dreams, two mysteries
combined to haunt him. Also it was
inevitable that these dreams should eventually
link up with the personal equation.</p>

<p>Breed slept one day on the crest of a knoll
and suddenly it was night instead of noon,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">20</a></span>
and Cripp and Peg were leaping about him
in a frenzy, their frothing jaws snapping on
the empty air in their madness. He faced
them with bared fangs,&mdash;and it was noon
once more, but the two old coyotes stood
before him in reality, their own noses wrinkled
in snarls which answered his menacing actions
and warned him off. The same old baffling
wave which flooded Breed after each of these
recurring dreams engulfed him now. Peg and
Cripp were as sane as himself, yet a moment
past they had been stricken before his very
eyes. It had been very real, and Breed
started suddenly from the knoll and headed
for the base of the hills five miles away, nor
did he stop until he was far back among their
sheltering ridges.</p>

<p>With the coming of the night he felt the
loss of the two old coyotes who had traveled
with him for the past three weeks. They
had been normal when he saw them last and
as this latter impression was the stronger he<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">21</a></span>
knew that he would find them untouched by
madness; yet the vividness of the dream
lingered with him and held him back from the
low country. He howled once and started
on a solitary hunt through the hills. The
cry drifted faintly to the flats below and
reached the ears of Cripp and Peg. They
started instantly in the direction from which
it came.</p>

<p>The chain of hills in which Breed hunted
was but an outcropping spur, extending thirty
miles eastward at right angles from the main
bulk of the hills, and he found no meat. The
elk and deer were high up in the parent range
and would stay there until heavy snows drove
them down to winter in the valleys of the
lower hills. Breed worked up the slope until
he reached the crest of the divide. He
prowled along the bald ridge, undecided
which course to take, then whirled and faced
back in the direction from which he had come.
Five miles below him a coyote had raised<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">22</a></span>
his voice; another answered. By traveling
steadily Cripp and Peg had covered much
ground since Breed's first cry of the night had
reached their ears and the two coyotes were
ten miles within the first folds of the hills and
still seeking the yellow wolf, the leader of the
pack.</p>

<p>Breed cupped his lips, his head stretched
forth and his muzzle depressed to a line
slightly below the peak of his shoulders as he
sent forth the hunting cry to summon his
loyal band. An hour later Cripp and Peg
were with him, the three of them swinging
west along the divide toward the rough mass
of the main range of hills. Morning found
them climbing through a matted jungle of
close-growing spruce and down-timber.</p>

<p>Breed chose a ridge that lifted above the
trees and there curled up for the day in a clump
of stunted sage. Coyotes hunt in the full
glare of the noonday sun as readily as at night
and Cripp and Peg slept a bare two hours<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">23</a></span>
before starting once more on the hunt. They
found small game less abundant in the high
hills than in the flats and they scoured the
surrounding timber without success, returning
at last to bed down near Breed on the open
ridge. Hunger drove Breed from his bed
before the sun had set and he headed deeper
into the hills, the two coyotes following, even
though they had small liking for this country
which seemed devoid of meat.</p>

<p>The yellow wolf sampled the cross currents
of air which drifted in from each branching
gulch. He crossed the cold trail scent of
several deer but was in no mood for following
a long trail so passed them by. It was the
actual warm body scent he sought. He
stopped suddenly with uplifted nose. The
shifting breezes had carried the deer scent
to his nostrils,&mdash;one brief flash and it was
gone. Breed tacked back and forth across
the wind, caught it again and held it, following
the ribbon of scent upwind as easily as a man<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">24</a></span>
would follow a blazed trail through the timber.
Two hundred yards from the start he sighted
his prey, a fork-horn buck grazing slowly
along under the trees. Breed turned his eyes
to either side to determine the location of
Cripp and Peg but they had suddenly vanished
from sight.</p>

<p>He crept toward the fork-horn, standing
without the moving of a muscle whenever
the young buck lifted his head, advancing
swiftly when he dropped it again to feed.
The wind held steadily from the deer to him
and Breed drew up to within fifty feet. The
buck lifted his head and looked off in all
directions, not from present uneasiness but
from his never-failing caution, then reached
for another bite of grass, and even as the downward
motion was started Breed launched
forward in a silent rush.</p>

<p>The fork-horn caught one backward slanting
glimpse of him and fled just as the wolf's teeth
clashed a bare inch short of his hamstring,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">25</a></span>
and Breed was off in pursuit of an animal
whose speed matched his own. This prey was
no awkwardly galloping steer but a nimble
beast that swept ahead in twenty-foot bounds,
and after fifty yards Breed was still ten feet
behind. Then a yellow streak darted over
a windfall jam and Peg flashed at the buck.
The deer turned almost at right angles in his
fright, and as he turned Breed's teeth slashed
his leg, but not deep enough to cripple, and
the chase was on again. Another fifty yards
and Cripp leaped from behind a spruce trunk
and struck gamely for a leg hold. The flying
speed of the buck jerked him clear of the
ground, broke the hold of his teeth and threw
him end over end. But he had retarded the
deer for one half-second and the yellow wolf
closed his jaws on a leg with all the force he
could throw into the drive. Breed too was
thrown, but the deer was turned again and
running with less than half his former speed,
one hind leg powerless. Peg was angling<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">26</a></span>
across to turn him still another time but Breed
overhauled him first and slashed at the other
leg, and as the deer rolled downhill the three-legged
coyote dodged the churning hoofs and
fastened on his throat.</p>

<p>Collins had journeyed far into the hills to
replenish his supply of meat. It was scarcely
dark under the trees when he heard the
breed-wolf and two coyotes howl together,&mdash;thirty
miles back in the heart of the hills!</p>

<p>"There now!" he exclaimed. "I've been
telling 'em right along that the coyotes would
take to the hills some day. Those breed-wolves&mdash;they'll
teach 'em to live in the hills."</p>

<p>When Breed had eaten his fill from the
deer he headed back for the low country.
The effect of the mad dream was waning
before the fact that Peg and Cripp were with
him in reality, sane and normal in every way.
The three of them were sluggish and heavy
with meat and they traveled slowly with
frequent halts for sleep.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">27</a></span></p>

<p>The following night Breed's howl sounded
again in the foothills and a score of coyotes
answered him from far and near. The coyote
tribe had learned that when the yellow wolf
prowled the range there would be fresh beef
for all. Each night the number of shadowy
forms that padded through the sage round
his kills increased, waiting until the wolf
should leave and they could close in and finish
it to the last mouthful. They grew bolder
from the fact that two of their own kind fed
with Breed, and on the first night after his
return from the hills three others found
courage to come in and feed upon his kill
before he left it. Within a week he was
accepted unreservedly as a member of the
coyote clan.</p>

<p>Each succeeding evening Breed found more
and more coyotes gathering swiftly toward
him at the first hunting cry of the night,
spreading out over a quarter-mile front and
running with him on the chase, knowing<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">28</a></span>
there would be meat in plenty at the end of
the run.</p>

<p>Collins noted a curious change in the coyote
signs in his immediate neighborhood. He
still found their tracks singly or in pairs,
where they wandered in all directions through
the sage in their hunts for jacks, or padded
thick round some spot where they had killed
a calf, but he soon discovered that whenever
he found a track which the breed-wolf had
left the night before he had only to swing out
to the right or left to find the trails of many
coyotes pointing in the same direction,&mdash;a
general movement of coyotes over a wide
front. Collins had heard many tales of late
which accorded with a prophecy he had made
long ago; for three hundred miles north and
south men who rode back into the mountains
reported seeing coyotes far back in the very
heart of them and of hearing their howls from
among the highest peaks. His prediction
that coyotes would take to the hills and feel<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">29</a></span>
as much at home high above <a name="timberline" id="timberline">timberline</a> as in
the flats had come to pass.</p>

<p>Collins studied long over the many coyote
trails which always paralleled the tracks of
the yellow wolf and made still another
prophecy,&mdash;that breed-wolves would teach
the coyotes to hunt in packs.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_II" id="CHAPTER_II"></a>CHAPTER II</h2>


<p>No man who has lived long in the open and
observed the ways of animals and birds doubts
that each tribe has a language of its own,&mdash;the
vocabulary of cadence and inflection.
A man may watch a marsh teeming with
waterfowl, their contented chuckles filling
his ears; then every wing will lift at once,
every bird roused to sudden flight by the
change of a single note so faint that it makes
no impression on the ear of the watching man,
yet sufficient to warn the birds as surely as
a gunshot. A widely scattered bunch of
range cows will graze placidly for hours, and
suddenly every head will be raised and every
cow gaze off in the same direction.</p>

<p>Coyotes catch all finely shaded inflections
and interpret them as unerringly as a man<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">31</a></span>
notes the difference between a bawling cow
and a blatting sheep. Mate communicates
with mate through all the coyote refrains of
the night; half-grown coyotes answer their
mother's voice but are silent when another
calls. All that wild outburst in which men
read only an uproar of meaningless savagery
is in reality the intelligent conversation of the
coyote nation.</p>

<p>Breed's range covered fifty miles each way
and there were some two hundred coyotes
who used the same strip or whose range overlapped
his own, and of these there were but
few who had not at one time or another
profited by some of his kills. Breed knew
the voice of every coyote in the little band
that made up his pack. Even when their
notes reached him faintly through a maze
of other howls his ears identified their voices
as certainly as the eyes of man pick out the
faces of his friends among a crowd. Those
coyotes in whom dog ancestry was less than<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">32</a></span>
four generations removed betrayed that fact
to him when they howled.</p>

<p>There are those who believe that the
shepherds and police dogs sprang originally
from the jackal. In any event, there are
more dogs that revert to the wild bunch from
these wolfish types than from all other kinds
combined. The gulf between shepherd and
coyote is not wide, and except when raiding
coyotes and stock-guarding dogs meet in
a clash of interests they are more apt to mate
than to fight.</p>

<p>Throughout the whole of Breed's range
there was but one note which puzzled him,&mdash;and
it was not the ancestry but the present
habits of the one who made the sound that
baffled him. The parental mixture was
plainly evidenced in the voice. It was the
cry of a she-wolf, a half-blood coyote and
dog, and Breed heard her howl night after
night yet could not locate her. He would
answer her cry and announce that he was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">33</a></span>
coming, but always she evaded him. When
he picked up her trail and followed it persistently,
it invariably led him toward an
isolated cabin. The wolf in him held him
back from too close an approach to the homes
of men. When he stopped she called again
from up near the twinkling windows of the
house. There was a lonesome note in her cry,
and it was furtive, carrying both fear and
invitation in its tones as if the she-wolf felt
herself an outcast and both longed and dreaded
to break down the bars between her wild
relatives and herself.</p>

<p>And she was an outcast, without doubt.
Collins had trailed her mother, a renegade
shepherd, to the den. He had turned in the
rest of the pups for bounty, keeping her for
a pet. She was slightly heavier than a coyote
and the fur of her back was dark, the badge
of shepherd parentage. The yellow underfur
showed through the black guard hairs of her
back-strip when the wind ruffled it, the black<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">34</a></span>
shading to yellow on flanks and sides, and
from this Collins called her Shady.</p>

<p>Shady's relations with men and beasts were
unsatisfactory in the extreme. Stockmen
hate the coyote with an intensity that they
show toward no other animal, and with good
reason, for the coyote meets them on a more
equal footing than other beasts, his strategy
outrivaling that of men. He repays their
cruelties against his kind by killing their
sheep and calves in broad daylight and executing
a well-covered retreat before the owners
can exact the penalty, then returning at night
to raise his jeering laughter almost under the
windows of his enemies.</p>

<p>Collins had no stock, his business being that
of killing coyotes, and he found far more to
admire than to despise in the qualities of his
prey and so did not accord coyotes the undying
hatred shown them by other men. In
his gruff way he was kind to Shady. Those
who came to his cabin were mainly stockmen<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">35</a></span>
and they hated Shady cordially. That she
sprang from a renegade sheep dog, a traitor
to her kind, was even more condemnatory in
their eyes than the coyote part of her.</p>

<p>The coyotes, less averse to the proximity
of man, had investigated Shady's case by
drawing nearer to the cabin than Breed would
go and so were no longer curious about her.
Breed was almost two years old yet he knew
nothing of dogs. His mother had ranged
a limited strip of country in which only two
men made their homes and neither had owned
dogs. When north with the wolves he had
met none of his domestic cousins except those
renegades or breeds that were of the wild. He
had crossed the trails of others at rare intervals.
Therefore he did not know dogs as
allies of men and so enemies to himself;
rather Shady seemed some extra-shy wolf
creature yet with sufficient courage to range
in close to men. She seemed a daring adventurer
to Breed.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">36</a></span></p>

<p>It was partly this curiosity which piqued
his interest in her. Then too he recognized
in her a freak type,&mdash;as he himself was a
freak. Each stood for the first generation
of a new breed, the equally divided parental
strains not yet dulled and blended by further
crosses, and so each of them recognized something
outstanding and unusual in the other.</p>

<p>At first their knowledge was confined to
what each learned of the other by ear alone,
unaided by the testimony of other senses.
Breed never once caught sight of her, and the
trail scent which she left behind told him
little except that she was half coyote and half
dog, as he already knew.</p>

<p>For a month he answered her howls, his
curiosity unassuaged. And as Breed puzzled
over Shady's voice, so Collins puzzled over
Breed's. Collins had heard him howl more
than a hundred times and knew that there
was some slight difference between his voice
and the pure wolf note. He had made a close<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">37</a></span>
study of animal sounds and knew them well.
He knew Shady's voice from that of other
coyotes. Her variations were less sharply
defined; more sustained than the bewildering
staccato of the coyote and with a slightly
coarser tone. Collins knew that he should
be able to detect that peculiarity in Breed's
howl,&mdash;a difference which he felt was there
but could not place. There were times when
the solution rose to the very surface of his mind
and struggled for interpretation into readable
thought, but always it eluded him in the end.</p>

<p>Shady came to listen for Breed's voice
among the multitude of other sounds, and
in some small measure she felt acquainted
with the yellow wolf. She missed his voice
on those nights when he hunted in some far
corner of his range and the familiar cry failed
to reach her.</p>

<p>This sense of familiarity led her at last to
wait for a sight of him. Breed traveled one
night toward the howl which always had the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">38</a></span>
power to draw him, and he suddenly saw
Shady fifty yards ahead. She would permit
of no nearer approach, fleeing before him as
he came on, stopping when Breed stopped,
but always keeping that fifty-yard gap between.
Every night for a week Breed strove
to narrow the breach, but without success;
but Shady's doubts were wearing down before
his constant advances and she found no
menace in his actions. She eventually
allowed Breed to draw near and they viewed
one another at a distance of ten yards. Their
course through the sage was a series of eccentric
loops as each circled repeatedly downwind
to catch the other's scent.</p>

<p>Then their relations were reversed, Breed
the retiring one, Shady the aggressive. There
was the scent of the stables, a horsy smell
that clung to Shady and which Breed could
not understand. There seemed too some
vague taint of man about her which held him
back. Shady grew bolder in the face of his<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">39</a></span>
timidity, and Breed's new-found suspicion
eventually waned before her friendly insistence.
Their friendship once established
they romped together night after night.</p>

<p>Shady was puzzled over the fact that this
new playmate invariably left her early in the
night. These meetings took place before
Breed raised his voice to summon the coyote
pack for the nightly hunt. He would break
off in the middle of a race and send out the
call, then leave the wondering Shady to her
own devices for the rest of the night.</p>

<p>His curiosity satisfied, Breed answered her
invitations less often and she saw him only at
infrequent intervals; and there was a reason
for this flagging interest. Wolves and coyotes
mate for life, or till one or the other of a pair
falls victim to the wiles of man. When once a
pair is broken the survivor will not take unto
himself another mate till the next running
time of wolves. There were pairs of coyotes
running together in Breed's pack; there were<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">40</a></span>
also single she-coyotes and single dogs, but
while the mated ones were as devoted as ever
before, these single ones had only a general
interest in the others, their attitude uninfluenced
by the lure of sex. And Shady,
hampered by her relations with man and so
unable to follow Breed's leadership at will,
exercised less influence over him than either
Peg or Cripp.</p>

<p>Breed killed abundantly, the coyotes picking
the last morsel of each victim before dawn.
Often he killed twice in one night. Word had
spread that a breed-wolf had turned up on the
range and was running with the coyotes.
Private rewards were added to the State
bounty till a total of two hundred dollars
was posted as the price on his scalp. Every
rider kept a sharp lookout for the breed; yet
so great was his caution that except for that
first day of his return, when Collins had seen
him on the rims, no man had set eyes on the
yellow wolf.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">41</a></span></p>

<p>Breed's watchfulness for traps and poison
baits had waned from the fact that he found
none of either on the range, and he now gave
them scarce a thought. On the other hand
his caution to avoid horsemen was quickened
from seeing many of them and his vigilance
in that particular was never relaxed. He
chose his beds with care and he slept so lightly
that the least sound penetrated his consciousness
and carried its message to his brain.
The shrill cachinnations of a prairie dog,
the shriek of a burrowing owl or the bawling
of a range cow; any of these usual sounds of
the open failed to rouse him; but invariably
he knew when a man was dangerously near.
If the menace was upwind and within reasonable
distance, his nose detected it. At times
the creak of saddle leather reached his ears
or the sound of the horse's hoofs warned him.</p>

<p>This hoof reading was a curious thing.
Breed could not tell why he knew when a
horse was ridden, but invariably he did.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">42</a></span>
If walking, the feet of an iron-shod horse
struck pebbles and rocks with a metallic
sound and Breed was suspicious of all horses
that wore shoes; but usually a rider traveled
at a steady trail trot. It was not the way
of loose horses to strike a steady, regular
gait and hold it, and the even vibrations of
a shuffling trail trot beat through all other
sounds and warned him that a horseman was
near.</p>

<p>Men grossly underestimate the keen
physical senses of the animal world, being
loath to credit them with finer sense perceptions
than those possessed by man, dulled
by countless centuries of disuse. A coyote
can scent the tracks left by a bird long hours
past; the smell of fresh blood is hot in his
nostril a full half-mile downwind while the
nose of man could scarce detect it at a distance
of two feet. His ears, attuned to
receive the delicately shaded tone inflections
of coyote converse, catch vibrations of sound<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">43</a></span>
far too fine to make the least impression on
the ears of man. And it is through these
sense impressions that animals are warned
at distances which men believe impossible
without the aid of some subtle intuition or
sixth sense. They speak of these things as
animal instinct and let it go at that.</p>

<p>In addition to this Breed had many other
ways of protection at his command; he
usually knew of the approach of man long
before the direct message reached him over
the paths of his own physical senses,&mdash;this
from his vast knowledge of the ways of
animals and birds and his ready understanding
of their widespread systems of communications.
Their actions frequently put
him on guard before his own senses apprised
him of the actuality of the danger.</p>

<p>These things, coupled with his own habits
and backed by coyote intelligence, made
Breed an animal most difficult to stalk.</p>

<p>Collins knew the wolf habit of bedding on<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">44</a></span>
a rise of ground. He knew too that the dog
who turns round and round before lying down
is not merely chasing his tail but instead is
exhibiting a relic of his wild ancestors' way
of rising frequently from his bed and turning
to look off in all directions before resuming it.
Day after day Collins swept the range with
powerful glasses and through his knowledge
and persistence he located Breed at last.</p>

<p>Breed lay on the crest of a knoll. Peg and
Cripp were hunting in the shallow basin
below him and he watched with keen interest
the diabolical cunning of his two chief
followers. Peg ranged in the open while
Cripp paralleled his course, moving along
just behind the wave of a low ridge. A long-eared
jack rabbit bounced from his bed in
front of Peg and fled swiftly for a hundred
yards, then halted to look back as he discovered
that he was not pursued. He reared
on his haunches, forefeet clear of the ground,
as he watched the coyote who had veered<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">45</a></span>
away from him and was now questing aimlessly
through the stunted sage. Peg turned
toward him again and the jack bounced away
toward the ridge, stopping again as Peg swung
away. From his point of vantage Breed could
see the cunning Cripp keeping even with the
jack, following closely its every move and
peering at it through the scattered sage that
topped the ridge. Peg, apparently unconscious
that there was meat in sight,
rambled in erratic tacks that crowded the
rabbit toward the ridge. Breed saw a crouching
shape slip behind a sage within ten feet
of the jack, whose eyes were occupied with
Peg. There was a flash of yellow as Cripp
struck him and the dying squall of the big
hare floated to Breed's ears. He rose from his
bed in excitement, then paused to sweep the
country with his gaze before resuming his nap.</p>

<p>Collins had seen! From the point of a
commanding ridge five miles away he had
centered his binoculars on the yellow wolf.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">46</a></span>
The wolfer's horse grazed in the bottom of
a gulch, his reins trailing loose, and Collins
moved swiftly down to him and swung to the
saddle. He had covered less than two hundred
yards before Breed, five miles away,
knew that a man rode toward him!</p>

<p>The pronghorn antelope has a most peculiar
signal system of his own. He is furnished
with a white patch on his rump, the hair
long and stiff, and when alarmed, instead of
bristling his neck roach as do other animals,
the antelope bristles this white rump patch.
The sun strikes light from the glistening hair
and every antelope within view follows suit; the
warning is flashed from band to band till every
antelope throughout an area of many miles
knows that some man is abroad on the plains.</p>

<p>Whenever a band of antelopes sported
within view of Breed his eyes flickered open
for frequent glimpses of them. Ten minutes
after the two coyotes had killed the jack
Breed opened his eyes for a view of a pronghorn<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">47</a></span>
buck that had taken his stand on a low
ridge half a mile away. Breed caught the
danger signal and was instantly alert. For
as far as his eye could reach he could see the
glistening points of light which he knew for
antelope flashes. The whole antelope tribe
was facing toward the danger and so pointed
out its direction for Breed. It is this sort
of signaling which men will not understand,
preferring instead to credit an animal, warned
at a distance of many miles, with some
mysterious occult knowledge.</p>

<p>A band of antelope joined the buck on the
ridge and fled with him toward Breed, stopped
to look back, stamping their feet excitedly,
then swept on past as a rider topped the ridge
they had just left.</p>

<p>Breed flattened in his nest, resting his head
between his paws. It was not his way to rush
off in panicky flight across the open at the first
glimpse of man, but rather the coyote way
of remaining motionless till the enemy had<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">48</a></span>
passed, or slipping away unseen if he came too
close. The horseman came on at an angle
that would take him three hundred yards
to one side, then altered his course and angled
the other way. He stopped to look over
a bunch of cows, shifted again to view another
bunch and circled round it; came on again
but turned to head a stray steer back toward
the rest. Collins was using the same tactics
in approaching Breed that the two coyotes
had so recently used to stalk the jack. He
seemed about to pass two hundred yards
away but lifted his horse into a keen run and
whirled him straight for the point of the knoll,
then shifted his course again to round the
shoulder of the little hill instead of over its
crest, knowing that Breed was running at
top speed down the opposite slope. He
pulled the horse back on his haunches and
flung from the saddle with the first glimpse
of the fleeing wolf.</p>

<p>Breed did not stop to look back as most<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">49</a></span>
other animals would have done but ran with
every ounce of his speed. He flinched away
from the sharp crack near his head as a rifle
ball passed him and the crash of the report
reached his ears. The next shot struck close
behind and the biting gravel stung him as the
ricochet hissed past within an inch of him.
He held straight ahead but resorted to the
coyote ruse of flipping from side to side in
sharp tacks, his tail snapping jerkily outward
to balance him on the turns. Bullets ripped
through the sage about him as Collins emptied
his gun. Then he was safe on the far side of
a swell and Collins was grinning ruefully at
a wolfless landscape.</p>

<p>"Coyote stuff!" he said. "A man might
as well gun up the corkscrew flight of a jacksnipe
as to pour lead through the gaps in
a side-steppin' freak like that. But you,
Breed,&mdash;you better keep your eye on me.
The Coyote Prophet is out for your scalp&mdash;so
walk soft, old boy,&mdash;walk soft."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">50</a></span></p>

<p>Breed struck a swift, gliding trot and held
it clear to the base of the hills, stopping only
when far up the first slope of them to sweep
the low country for sight of his enemy. That
night when he raised his howl it reached the
ears of perhaps a hundred coyotes far out
across the flats and immediately thereafter
there was a strange movement in the coyote
tribe. The majority of them rambled in all
directions on personal business or pleasures
of their own but through it all, strung out
over a five-mile front, more than a dozen
coyotes were running swiftly toward the hills.
They were not to be turned aside but held
their course, gathering to the wolf who had
led them to many a kill,&mdash;willing to follow
wherever he should lead. An hour later,
when Breed raised his voice from the divide,
a wave of coyote answers rose in unison and
when he headed toward the parent range
there were fourteen coyotes traveling with
him through the hills. They moved together,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">51</a></span>
but not as man understands that term, for
they did not travel closely grouped. Some
were half a mile to either side and some far
behind, and there were gaps of several hundred
yards in the line. Their trails sometimes
shifted and crossed, but noses and ears kept
them well informed as to the locality and
actions of the rest.</p>

<p>They entered the rough mass of the main
range and pushed on, traveling in this loose
formation. Toward morning Breed stopped
and listened to a far-off sound which reached
him. Every coyote in the pack had also
stopped to listen, their red tongues circling
hungrily along their lips as they caught the
significance of the sound.</p>

<p>There were no sheep on Breed's immediate
range. Trouble between the cowmen and
those who grazed sheep had been temporarily
adjusted by apportioning the range. Sheep
now grazed far to the south but the cowmen
allowed the privilege of pastoral transportation<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">52</a></span>
across the cattle strip twice a year
for those who summered their sheep in the
hills. The snows were late in falling and the
flocks had been held correspondingly late high
in the hills.</p>

<p>Breed had known sheep in the past,&mdash;and
this was the sound of sheep. Two herders
had combined their bands to work them down
to the low country and the camp tender stayed
to help them with the crossing. Breed
listened long to the droning undertone, the
maddening blat of five thousand woollies
on the bed ground, its querulous volume persisting
through the sound of water and wind
and drifting to him across a distance of five
miles. Then he stretched forth his head and
issued his hunting cry.</p>

<p>The savage peal ripped through the plaintive
chant of the sheep as the prow of a canoe
cuts sluggish water, and traveling against
the current of sound it reached the ears of
the camp tender who rolled over in his blankets<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">53</a></span>
and cursed. There was a half-minute cessation
of the baa and blat, and before it
was resumed the tender had prodded the two
herders into wakefulness.</p>

<p>"Better sleep with one eye open," he
advised. "There's a wolf in the hills. Just
crossing through, mebbe&mdash;but anyhow you
better stay awake to hold the sheep while
I fire a shot to scare him off if he comes too
close. He'll put 'em off the bed ground and
scatter 'em if he slips past the dogs."</p>

<p>The cry sounded again, this time less than
a mile away, and a clamor of coyote howls
rose with it.</p>

<p>"Coyotes!" the tender exclaimed.
"Night shooting won't scare those cunning
devils off,&mdash;they know a man can't see at
night. It sounds like they was running in a
pack, and enough of 'em to make a noise like
as if the whole damn coyote nation had took
to the hills. Wonder how come they're
pranking round with a wolf? They'll likely<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">54</a></span>
only hang along to cut out some strays&mdash;but
if they do come in close in a mob like that,
it's good night, sheep! Them shaller-brained
woollies will take to the peaks."</p>

<p>The sheep had risen from their beds and
were huddled close. The tender and herders
stood with drawn guns and the three dogs
bristled savagely and turned their gaze toward
the timbered slope that rose on one side of
the open side-hill bench that served as a bed
ground. There was a movement among the
sheep; the fleecy mass buckled and surged
as those on the outer edge turned and sought
safety by plowing toward the close-packed
center. The three men stationed themselves
in a triangle three hundred yards apart,
hoping to steady the sheep and hold them.
The dogs circled swiftly round the milling
horde, driving merciless teeth into every panic-stricken
sheep who sought to quit the flock.
The whole mass suddenly crowded off to one
side and all three dogs sped round to hold them.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">55</a></span></p>

<p>One herder saw a flitting streak leave the
timber edge and glide toward the sheep;
another; there was no moon and he could
not be sure. His gun barked twice as a dozen
shadowy forms crossed the open, strung out
for two hundred yards. Then hell broke
loose on the bed ground.</p>

<p>The fear-crazed horde streamed past the
other herder and the tender. They shouted
and struck out with heavy staffs, trying to
stem the tide and turn it back. The resistless
sea of fleece surged on and was swallowed
in the gloom of the heavy timber down the
slope. And in the center of it all Breed and
the coyote pack were working.</p>

<p>They ripped through the mob and split
it; drove through again. The sheep split
into a hundred small detachments and
blundered on under the trees. The men
stumbled through the down-timber windfalls
and their shouts and the frantic barking of
the dogs rose above the clamor of the sheep,&mdash;but<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">56</a></span>
there was not a sound from the yellow
killers who had started the stampede. Every
coyote knew the location of the men and
each one singled out a stray band for his own
and swept ahead with it. The dogs worked
like fiends but the marauders were in too great
force for them. Whenever a dog bore down
upon a coyote the raider fled straight away
from the sheep and their blats recalled the
dog to duty. The mad wave rolled down the
slope and up the next.</p>

<p>The first light of dawn revealed each of the
three dogs holding a large band of sheep.
The two herders and the camp tender had
each rounded up a smaller bunch. They
worked their separate ways back toward the
bed ground, gathering strays along the way.
The camp tender held them in the open while
the two herders and the dogs combed the
surrounding hills for stragglers; and as they
worked they cursed the coyote and his ways.
It was no unusual thing in their experience<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">57</a></span>
for a few coyotes to fly at a bunch of sheep
and scatter them, cutting out a few that
straggled away from the protection of men
and dogs, but this savage attack in pack
formation and the harrying of five thousand
head of sheep far through the hills was new
to them.</p>

<p>All through the morning they rounded
stragglers toward the flock and shortly after
noon they headed the tired sheep down
toward the foothills, fearing a repetition of
the stampede. Just at dusk they milled the
sheep and bedded them on a ridge in the low
country, a mile from the base of the timbered
hills.</p>

<p>The camp tender looked them over with
practiced eye and shook his head.</p>

<p>"There's no chance to make a count
now," he said. "But when we do make one
it's dollars to dimes that we'll tally out two
hundred short."</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_III" id="CHAPTER_III"></a>CHAPTER III</h2>


<p>Collins had waited till the fur was prime
and the flesh side of the coyote pelt showed
flint white before throwing out his trap line.
He made the first set three hundred yards
from the cabin, choosing the spot with care,
for he knew that the last place a coyote would
enter was the one where guiding clumps of
sage formed an inviting lane across the traps.
He selected an open spot instead and dismounted
on a sheep pelt spread flat upon
the ground; with a hand-axe he hewed out
a triangular trap bed a foot across by three
inches deep, placing every shred of fresh
earth removed from it in a canvas sack; then
he fitted a heavy Newhouse four in place with
both springs bent far to the rear and drove
a slender steel pin out of sight through the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">59</a></span>
swivel ring of the chain. He smoothed a
piece of canvas under the jaws and over the
pan and poured the soft earth over it all,
filling it level with the surface and tamping
it firmly with his fingers except that within
the six-inch circle of the jaws. From a
second sack he sifted dust over the spot till
it matched the surrounding flat, remounted
and leaned from the saddle to recover the
sheep pelt on which he had knelt and used
it as a fan to whip the dust of the flat into
curling eddies which settled back so uniformly
as to defy the eyes of any man to detect the
location of the trap. The surplus earth removed
from the hole he carried away to be
emptied far from the spot. For Collins
knew the qualities of his prey and a good
wolfer leaves no sign. He had used no
foolish scent to disguise his own, knowing
that the heat of day and the frost of night
would diffuse his scent and obliterate all trace
of it, the same as an animal's trail grows cold<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">60</a></span>
in time, while any foreign odor lingering
longer than his own would only serve as a
guide for the cunning prey he sought.</p>

<p>The wisdom of the fox has furnished theme
for song and legend, and only those who have
followed the trap line for both fox and coyote
know that Reynard's vaunted brain is but
a dry sponge when compared to the knowledge-soaked
brain of the prairie wolf. It is
the way of the coyote to live near man,
confident that his own cunning will offset
that of his arch enemy and lead him unscathed
through all the contrivances men
may employ for his destruction. Collins
knew that the fox was only trap-shy while
the coyote was&mdash;vast difference between the
two&mdash;trap-wise; that he would go to a bait,
knowing the traps were there, and risk his
life in an effort to uncover them and so leave
evidence behind that he was keener than his
foe.</p>

<p>At the end of a week Collins had thrown<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">61</a></span>
out three pear-shaped loops of traps, each
line with a length of twenty miles, the whole
a clover-leaf effect with his cabin as the base.
He had used no bait until his scent should have
been blotted out round his traps, not from
fear that coyotes would not approach the bait
while his scent was fresh but from certain
knowledge that they would approach too
soon, locate his traps and uncover them.
When the third trap circle was complete he
started back over the first and baited the
sets, then commenced the steady routine
of riding one string each day and thus covering
his entire line in three days.</p>

<p>Shady frequently accompanied Collins on
these trips and when he made a trap set she
sat down some distance away and watched
him with full understanding of what he was
about; for Shady's past experience with
traps had been large. She had seen Collins
take many a coyote from his traps. Twice
she had slipped away to steal the bait from<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">62</a></span>
some set near the cabin and both times had
felt the sudden deadly clutch of steel jaws
on her foot, remaining in their grip till Collins
had released her. She had seen coyotes dead
and bloated from eating poison baits,&mdash;and
meat was now a danger signal to Shady, not
a lure. She would touch no food except that
which she obtained at the cabin.</p>

<p>The trap line had yielded many coyote
pelts while Breed was still in the hills and he
knew nothing of the widespread mortality
among the coyotes in his absence or the dangers
which lurked in wait for him on his return.</p>

<p>There were two hundred sheep scattered
for miles through the hills and Breed and the
coyote pack found easy killing. Winter had
claimed the lofty peaks, while but little snow
had fallen below timber line.</p>

<p>Breed sensed the coming storm. The
movements of the elk herds told him it would
be a heavy one. It was nearing the end of
the elk rutting moon but the bulls were still<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">63</a></span>
bugling. Breed heard the clear bugle note
of an old herd bull, the piercing sound reaching
him from many miles back among the
snowy peaks. It was closely followed by
others. The elk migration had begun; the
herds were evacuating the lofty basins of
their summer range and boiling out through
the high passes of the peaks before the snowfall
of the coming storm should block them
in,&mdash;coming down to winter in the lower
valleys of the hills.</p>

<div class="link">

   </a>
   <p class="caption">The elk migration had begun. <i><a href='#Page_63'>Page 63</a>.</i></p>
</div>

<p>The certainty with which animals gauge
a coming storm is cited as proof of that
mysterious instinct with which men credit
them; yet this information may reach them
through known laws. Breed knew of it from
the elk movements, and it is probable that
the elk in turn were warned from some
similarly natural source,&mdash;perhaps from
atmospheric changes, more likely from the
flight of migratory birds.</p>

<p>A marshland may be empty of certain<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">64</a></span>
species of ducks in the fall; then suddenly
a flock will pitch down out of the blue, followed
by another and another till the whole
sky is streaked with the oncoming horde.
They will feed and start on, the belated
arrivals not even alighting but holding straight
ahead. The flight ceases as suddenly as it
commenced and inevitably a storm drives
down out of the north in the wake of the
flocks. But this is not instinct. The storm
strikes those birds that have remained farthest
north and as they scurry ahead of it the more
southerly ones take wing. Many ducks fly
at rates of speed that are well over a hundred
miles an hour and so can distance the swiftest
storms. Even the ears of man may detect
the difference between the wing-whistlers
of a flock of mallards or other slow-flying
ducks and the humming screech of redhead
or canvasback hurtling through the night with
tremendous speed; and animals note such
things more readily than man.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">65</a></span></p>

<p>In any event Breed knew of the coming
storm many hours before the first soft flakes
fell and melted on his yellow coat. He took
shelter under the low-hanging branches of
a stunted spruce and slept. It snowed for
two days and throughout that time there was
little sound in the hills. Each coyote in the
pack had sought out a similar shelter, the
mated pairs bedding together, the others
singly. No one of them howled during the
storm. The elk and deer held to their beds
without a sound. The few stragglers who
had not yet crossed out through the passes
were the only ones that moved, pushing on
through the storm, and the herd bulls traveling
with them bugled to hold their cows together;
but the snow-filled air deadened these distant
sounds. And for two days Breed heard
nothing but the soft hissing of the snow
through the branches or the groaning of overburdened
trees. The third night a big gray
owl hooted gruffly an hour before dawn, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">66</a></span>
as if dispersed by the sound of his voice the
last gray clouds scudded past and the stars
flamed from the steel-blue sky of night.</p>

<p>A savage wind sprang up with the sun,
shrieking along the exposed ridges and rippling
the valleys of lodgepole pine, hurling its
force against the spruce slopes. For another
day Breed heard only the howl of the gale,
the snow sliding from the swaying branches
and the sudden crash of falling trees,&mdash;not
a sound of life. The fury of the wind abated
toward night and an hour after dark there
was a sudden lull followed by one last rush
of wind, leaving the white hills wrapped in
a vast silence.</p>

<p>Breed heard a single bugle note of a young
bull, the last he was to hear for another ten
months, for the mating time of the antlered
tribes had been ushered out with the storm.
The gray owls hooted the warning that they
would soon set forth on silent wings to strike
down any small creature that moved across<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">67</a></span>
the white carpet under the trees. The elk
were working back up to the bald ridges
that had been blown free of snow. All the
night-feeders of the wild prowled in search
of food after the fast.</p>

<p>Breed raised the hunting cry and the coyote
pack answered roll call. They were gaunt
and their flanks were pinched up and hollowed
from the three-day famine. They ran silently
and with but a single purpose, spurred on by
hunger. A coyote far out on one flank of
the pack winded a bunch of elk and headed for
them. The elk accorded him scarcely a
glance as he drew near. In an earlier day,
before the white man had invaded the foothills,
the elk herds had wintered there, but
the coyotes had not molested them; of late
a few coyotes had invaded the high country,
the summer range, but the elk did not fear
them.</p>

<p>The coyote howled, one short eager blast,
and angled in between the herd and a straggler<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">68</a></span>
on the edge of it, a yearling elk, a spike bull,
his first antler growth consisting of two
pointed spikes eighteen inches long. He
was not alarmed,&mdash;but it was a new kind of
coyote that faced him now, one that had
learned pack hunting under the leadership
of the yellow wolf.</p>

<p>The coyote made a swift lunge and drove
his teeth in one hind leg. The young bull
whirled and aimed a sweeping slash of his
polished spears, intent upon impaling his foe;
and as he turned a second coyote flashed from
behind a tree and slashed him. The bull
whirled again and struck wickedly with a
smashing forefoot. The rest of the elk had
stopped to gaze in amazement at this strange
scene,&mdash;at coyotes attacking an elk.</p>

<p>Every coyote in the pack had altered his
course at that short howl, wheeling as at
a command. Yellow shapes had appeared
as if by magic and were sliding under the
trees on silent feet and circling the bull.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">69</a></span>
There was something sinister and purposeful
in this concerted action and the rest of the
elk milled about uneasily and at last turned
and trotted off. The spike bull fought with
hoof and horn, but at every turn a coyote
slashed him from behind, striking always
at the hamstring. His rage turned to fear
and he fled. He struck the heavy four-foot
drifts where the wind had scoured the snow
from the ridge above and sifted it deep in the
timber. His sharp hoofs and heavier weight
let him deep into the snow while the coyotes
padded easily along, their feet sinking in but
a few inches. He tired himself with desperate
charges at some coyote that always eluded
him while others drove fangs in him from
behind. More coyotes joined the running
fight and he was far gone before Breed drove
through the pack and struck him with all
the force of a killing wolf. He spent the last
of his ebbing strength in a whirlwind of furious
fighting, then went down and the yellow<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">70</a></span>
horde swarmed over him. They fed long
and when they left the feast they were no
longer gaunt. Flanks had filled out and
paunches sagged heavily, nearly touching
the snow. The following night they returned
to the kill and finished it. Then Breed
headed back for the open sagebrush foothills.
The immediate fear of being shot had departed,
leaving only the lesson as a reminder
of his narrow escape.</p>

<p>The pack reached the edge of the hills in
the first morning light and many of them
kept on, but Breed, more averse to daylight
traveling than they, would not venture down
till night. The low country lay spread out
below him, ragged patches of brown alternating
with those of dirty white, the wind having
scoured the snow from open grass-country
and piled it to the tops of the sage in the
heavier clumps and in long drifts trailing
away downwind behind them, or packed it
in the depths of badland washes and cracks.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">71</a></span>
The powdery snow had been swept from the
open before it had time to melt and the dry
air of the hill country had sucked up what
little moisture remained, leaving the flats
almost as dusty as before.</p>

<p>With nightfall Breed descended to the
tongue of the foothills that reached up into
the notch formed by the outcropping spur
where it joined the main range at right angles.
Thirty miles east along this Hardpan Spur
was his home territory and he followed along
the base of it. Not till within ten miles of
Collins' cabin did he howl. The wolfer heard
it, and again he had the feeling that he could
almost name that peculiarity in Breed's note,
but before he could give it expression the
solution was slipping away from him as
always before. He could feel the odd quality
but it defied analysis in words.</p>

<p>Shady too had heard the call and answered
it. Breed started toward her but stopped
abruptly and tested the wind. The scent<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">72</a></span>
of stale meat played on his nostrils and he
veered aside to investigate. He moved along
a cow trail and peered from the edge of the
sage at a ten-pound chunk of meat that lay
in the center of an open flat. He knew what
that meant. Suspicion flooded him and every
hair tingled as he realized that this was the
work of man. Traps! No coyote on the
range would have found need to look twice
at the tempting morsel to know that it had
not come there by accident but had been
placed by some man as a coyote lure.</p>

<p>Breed, springing as he did from two wise
tribes, had been educated in two schools.
His coyote mother had led him to meat,
knowing men had put it there to bait her, and
she had taught him to detect the most cunningly
buried trap. Later he had practiced
this art himself. The old dog wolf who was
his father had followed one simple rule which
served him well. He killed each meal as he
felt the need of it and would touch no other<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">73</a></span>
food, not even returning to previous kills of
his own. Breed was possessed of both traits
in moderation, inclining to either for long
periods as his moods varied. Breed moved
to within ten feet of the meat and extended
one forepaw, feeling cautiously through the
carpet of dust, then pushed it two inches
ahead. For a solid hour that paw was not
once lifted from the ground except when the
other was pushed forward to replace it. He
moved ahead an inch at a time, the edging
forepaws feeling through the dust for the least
sign of loosened earth beneath. He knew
that the crushing jaws of a trap yawned
beneath the surface somewhere near the meat.
His eyes swept every inch of ground for a sign
that differed from the rest and his nose
quested for a spot which held the taint of
man. A faint trace of it pervaded the place,
coming mainly from the bait itself and almost
blotted by the meat scent.</p>

<p>Cripp and Peg watched every move from<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">74</a></span>
a distance of ten feet. Two young coyotes
had come to the spot and one of them worked
in toward the bait from the opposite side,
using the same tactics as those employed by
Breed. At the end of an hour Breed stood
within three feet of his goal and the out-stretched
paw suddenly touched yielding
earth. He scratched gently along the edge
of this softened spot; a claw scraped some
solid substance and the moonlight glinted
on a point of naked steel. Breed pushed his
paw beneath it and gently lifted till half of
a deadly four-pound trap showed above the
dust. He looked long at it, then veered past
it to the bait; and the young coyote edged
in from the other side. Breed's feet did not
shift an inch as he tore a mouthful from the
meat, but the young coyote across from him
strained to drag the whole of it from the spot.
It was wired solidly to a stake and he shifted
far to either side in his vain efforts to dislodge
it. There was a hissing grate of loosened<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">75</a></span>
springs and the young coyote felt the bone-shattering
snap of a trap as it closed on his
foot. Breed whirled and leaped ten feet
away, from which point he watched the
struggles of his ill-fated friend. In his
desperate struggles to free himself the young
coyote leaped clear across the meat and the
trap that Breed had unearthed closed on
another foot. Breed circled uneasily round
the spot, powerless to help the coyote that
was stretched full length between two traps,
yet he lingered till an hour before dawn.</p>

<p>This experience quickened old fears in
Breed. Memories of past horrors, long dormant
but not forgotten, welled up out of his
mind to increase his caution, and fresh pangs
were added by similar discoveries on each
succeeding night. The whole range seemed
studded with fearsome traps and the odor of
stale meat was borne on every breeze. There
were few nights when he did not find some
animal fast in one of these man-made snares.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">76</a></span>
Each new victim acted differently, according
to the characteristics of its kind. Breed found
a badger in a trap and the animal ceased his
struggle long enough to wrinkle his nose and
hiss at Breed with a thick snakelike sound.
The badger's forepaws were more than twice
the size of his hind feet, and were fitted with
heavy two-inch claws, while those of the hind
feet measured but half an inch. He was
caught by one hind foot, leaving the powerful
spading forks of the forepaws free to work.
He had always found safety by burrowing in
the ground and so now, in his last extremity,
he turned to digging and plowed every inch
of the surface within reach. He settled on one
spot at last and burrowed from sight. Breed
watched the heaving dirt till it ceased to
move as the badger settled comfortably in
fancied security, buried to the full limit of
the trap chain.</p>

<p>Some nights later Breed passed a cross fox
that had strayed down from the high country<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">77</a></span>
and had stepped into one of Collins' traps.
The fox was never still, weaving in and out,
looping and turning round the pin that held
the trap; lashed into constant movement
by his native nervousness but making no
strenuous efforts to break loose. Later the
same night he found a bobcat. The big cat
made no move save a slight creasing of his
facial muscles preparatory to a snarl if the
wolf drew near. The first pain had dulled
and he rested quietly, lacking the hardihood
to stretch his own flesh and bones in a struggle
against the trap.</p>

<p>But Breed always found a trapped coyote
fighting,&mdash;fighting silently and gamely to
the last heartbeat. Coyotes are high in the
scale of intelligence and so each one has an
individuality of his own. One would surge
time after time against the chain, driving
savagely to the end of it. Another would
grind his teeth against the cold steel till his
jaws dripped blood, while a third would<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">78</a></span>
amputate the mangled foot. But whatever
the method, the basic fact was the same,&mdash;no
coyote waited submissively for his fate but
waged a ceaseless, desperate fight for freedom.</p>

<p>All these things heightened Breed's suspicions.
He felt the reassertion of wolfish
caution within him, driving out the coyote
desire to outwit man. Three times he unearthed
the traps and stole the bait. Then
he refused to go near stale meat. He was
nauseated by the smell of it and merely
avoided instead of investigating the spots
from which the scent came to him. And
this was not through fear of traps&mdash;he retained
full confidence in his ability to detect
them&mdash;but from the fact that wherever he
had found traps in the past he had also found
poison and so these two were associated
together in his mind.</p>

<p>Throughout a whole month of accustoming
himself to these new conditions, Breed had
visited Shady but twice. He had the companionship<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">79</a></span>
of coyotes to fill his time and the
lonesome howls of the she-wolf were unanswered.
It is the stock dog without steady
occupation that reverts to the wild. Mere
inactivity, even if coupled with kindness, is
insufficient to still his natural restlessness and
fill his life; he must have careful training
and active employment to be content,&mdash;and
Shady was half wild.</p>

<p>The mating time of wolves was drawing
near and Breed caught the new note in Shady's
voice. He dropped all other business to
hurry to her. Though the season was yet
some time ahead they knew its nearness and
each recognized in the other a possible future
mate.</p>

<p>Collins thought of Shady more as a pet than
as a dog and so had not troubled to train her.
The wild traits in her were as apparent in
maturity as they had been in infancy&mdash;even
more pronounced&mdash;and chief among these
was her natural aptitude for stealing. She<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">80</a></span>
pillaged Collins' stores and even sneaked food
from the table when his back was turned, as
her wild ancestors for many generations had
stolen his bait. Collins curbed this propensity,
not by judicious training which would
eliminate it, but by the simple process of
chaining her to the cabin wall when he left
for a trip and did not wish her to accompany
him. So it was not strange that Shady
viewed thieving from the standpoint of expediency.
Those who came to Collins' cabin
predicted a bad end for Shady.</p>

<p>That insistent note in her voice was more
pronounced as the season neared and Breed
tingled to the sound of it. The frequency
of his visits increased till they were of nightly
occurrence instead of semi-monthly. He used
every wolfish inducement to lure her away
from the vicinity of the twinkling lights that
marked the abode of man. She longed to
follow him into the wild but could not bring
herself to face its terrors. Breed longed to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">81</a></span>
follow her when she left him but could not
bring himself to face the horrors which must
lurk near the haunts of men. These clashing
outlooks upon life held them apart. The
wild represented safety for Breed, its dangers
known to him and accepted as a part of it
and not to be greatly feared. Those dangers
were the work of man, and by natural consequence
Breed assumed that their numbers
and deadliness increased in proportion as he
drew nearer the homes of men, the house itself
the most dangerous of all. Shady's mode
of life had taught her the reverse of this;
that complete safety lay in the cabin and its
immediate vicinity, the known and unknown
terrors of the wild increasing in ever-widening
circles dependent upon the distance from the
refuge of the cabin that was home to her.</p>

<p>The season had started and some few
coyotes had paired, yet Breed could not
induce Shady to follow him. The preceding
winter her desire for motherhood had been<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">82</a></span>
thwarted. Collins had chained her to the
cabin for a month. Coyotes are without
the wolf suspicion which fills their larger
cousins with fear of human habitations,
and they are prone to investigate them at
night while a wolf will not approach. Several
dog coyotes had braved the dangers of Collins'
cabin in answer to Shady's howls. Her soft
whimpering had roused the wolfer each time
this occurred and every new admirer had been
greeted with a charge of buckshot as he
slipped toward the house, three dog coyotes
having paid for their temerity with their lives.</p>

<p>The Coyote Prophet intended the same
imprisonment for Shady the present season
but he neglected it one day too long. He
came from the cabin, a collar and chain in
his hand, only to see Shady slip away into the
dusk. A minute later she howled.</p>

<p>Breed heard it. Every fiber of him
quivered to the sound. It was the mating
call!<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">83</a></span></p>

<p>Collins whistled in vain. There was no
answering whimper from Shady. But the
habit of obedience was strong in her and she
lingered within sound of it. Breed came
nearer than ever before, his fears dulled by
the message she had sent him. Collins came
from the house again and whistled shrilly.
Breed shrank from the sound and drew back
as Shady trotted a short distance toward the
house; she answered the whistle with an
uneasy whine and Collins moved in the
direction from which it came, coaxing as he
advanced.</p>

<p>Fear flooded Breed. It spurred him to
sudden rushes of flight which were halted
in a few stiff bounds as the longing for Shady
cried out against his leaving her. Then came
the clanking of the chain in Collins' hand. It
was the clank of a trap chain to Breed,&mdash;and
he was off. That same sound, its meaning
so different for each of them, resulted in
flight for both. Shady ran with him through<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">84</a></span>
the night, and once started it was not so hard
to keep on. And as she ran she transferred
her trust from Collins to Breed, giving herself
entirely into his keeping to lead her through
the unknown perils which lay ahead,&mdash;and
she ran close to him, her nose almost touching
his flank.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_IV" id="CHAPTER_IV"></a>CHAPTER IV</h2>


<p>The exhilarating element of danger in trap
robbing, which appeals so strongly to the
coyote, held no fascination for Shady. She
was vastly trap-wise but used her knowledge
solely for self-preservation. Every scrap of
meat on the range represented possible pain
or death to her and she found no sport in
close investigation with its attendant risks.
She was entirely dependent upon Breed, feeling
a sense of security in his nearness, but weighed
down by the vast unknown which seemed to
close in upon her whenever the gap between
them exceeded the span of one leap. She
would not touch any food other than that
which he provided.</p>

<p>The coyotes clustered round the steer
that Breed pulled down a few hours after<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">86</a></span>
luring Shady from the cabin and she viewed
them suspiciously, warning them off by repeated
growls. Peg and Cripp edged in to
feed. Shady's protest rose frenziedly and
she raged at them but did not attack, and the
two old coyotes eyed her warily as they ate.
She noted that Breed accepted their presence
and she quieted and patterned her actions
according to her mate's.</p>

<p>The rest of the pack came in. Her uneasiness
persisted and for an hour she ate
but little, edging away from physical contact
with those who crowded about her. She
pressed close to Breed's side and whirled to
snap at any coyote who attempted to wedge
between them, but her suspicions subsided
as she found that these nips were never
returned. Whenever a dog coyote was inclined
to make friendly advances to Shady
a low growl from Breed warned him from her
side. The sense of strangeness, of having
been catapulted from a sheltered life into<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">87</a></span>
the midst of a growling mob, wore off and
Shady rapidly accustomed herself to these
new conditions.</p>

<p>The feast was but half finished when the
head of every coyote in the pack was raised
at once and the shuffling feet and grinding
jaws were stilled as a timber wolf howled
from the slope of the Hardpan Spur. All
animal sounds were suspended till the last
ripples of Breed's answering cry died away;
then lesser beasts, having preserved strict
silence while two mighty hunters spoke,
resumed their own interrupted communications.</p>

<p>The Coyote Prophet heard the two cries,
and that baffling quality in Breed's voice
was instantly clear to him, as was the reason
why he had never before been able to give it
name. He had quested for the difference
with his ear,&mdash;and the difference lay in the
feel of the sound. Collins had felt the crawling
of his flesh and the roughening of his skin<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">88</a></span>
at the gray wolf's cry; for a man may hear
that note every night of his life and the wolf
shiver will shake his frame the last time it
sounds as surely as it does the first. It is
not fear; no man can name it; but the wolf
shiver is as inseparably linked with the wolf
howl as the involuntary gasp is linked with
a dash of ice water on the spine. And Collins
knew that that quality was lacking in Breed's
cry. The personality of the gray wolf was
marked by absolute savagery, his bleak outlook
on life undiluted by a single ray of that
humor which is so evident in every act of the
dog and the prairie wolf; and this difference
of temperament was reflected in his voice,
apparent to the ears of the animal world,
apparent to Collins only in the different way
in which his subconscious mind reacted to
his howl. Collins, having once defined
Breed's note, its sound so identical with that
of the wolf howl yet so dissimilar in the elusive
feeling which accompanied it, had no further<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">89</a></span>
doubt that he could thereafter identify Breed
by his howl.</p>

<p>"You, Breed! I've got your number
now," he said. "I could pick you out from
amongst a hundred wolves." This was merely
a casual assertion, a self-congratulation over
having solved the puzzle, and the Coyote
Prophet made it without a thought that the
day would ever come when he might have
opportunity to file it among prophecies fulfilled.</p>

<p>The wolf howl affected Shady in a similar
way, its stark savagery clashing discordantly
with the dog strain in her. She felt the
grating along her spine, and the hair rose with
it. There was an air of expectancy among
the coyotes. Heads were raised between
mouthfuls and all eyes were repeatedly
turned toward the hills. It was the first
time that Shady had heard the cry of one of
the big gray hunters. She noted the tension
among her new friends without reading its<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">90</a></span>
portent. Of them all, Breed seemed the only
one unaffected. One by one the coyotes
left the feast, then the remaining few sidled
hurriedly away as a huge dog wolf moved
swiftly across the flat. His pace slowed as
he neared the kill and he halted ten feet away,
his quivering nose taking stock of the two who
fed there.</p>

<p>Shady's long run through the sage had
whipped her soft fur full of sage dust, its sharp
scent nearly obliterating the conglomerate
smell of the cabin which usually clung to her.
The reek of coyote scent and fresh blood that
permeated the spot still further concealed it,
and though the wolf caught the peculiar odor
he could not trace its source to her without
closer inspection. He was hungry and advanced
to the meat, tearing off huge bites and
gulping them down till the wire edge of his
hunger was appeased, then sidled cautiously
round the steer to nose the mating she-wolf.
As he neared her his eyes peered over her at<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">91</a></span>
Breed. That foreign odor which he had
noted he now traced to Shady, but having once
accepted her it did not trouble him. Shady
flinched away from him and Breed's lips
writhed up and cupped away from his ivory
fangs. There was no mistaking the snarl
that accompanied this baring of his teeth and
the gray wolf moved back to the opposite
side of the steer.</p>

<p>Thereafter both wolves ate sparingly and
each watched for the least hostile move in
the other. The coyote pack ringed in close,
awaiting the departure of the timber wolf.
He frequently turned his head and favored
the closer ones with a baleful stare, the move
always accompanied by a flattening of his
ears, and the ones so fixed by his appraising
eye shrank deeper into the sage. Each time
this occurred his head swung abruptly back
toward Breed.</p>

<p>Shady feared and hated the wolf. If she
thought of him in human words she would<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">92</a></span>
have given him the name of Flatear, and with
good reason. In coyote, fox and wolf the
ears are even more expressive than the eyes.
A wolf's ears work when he sleeps, one of them
inclining toward the least sound that reaches
him. When awake his ears seem to work
automatically in conjunction with nose and
eyes, tipping sharply forward and turning in
the direction of any strange object or questionable
scent that excites his curiosity. And
the flattening of the ears is indicative of his
mood, preceding even the snarl, their backward
angle an accurate gauge of his intent.
It seemed to Shady that the big wolf's ears
were chronically laid as he regarded Breed.
She was unversed in the ways of her wild
kinsfolk and could not know that the yellow
wolf and the gray were sparring for the advantage
of the first blow in the savage fight
that would soon be waged for the right of
proprietorship,&mdash;herself as the prize.</p>

<p>Both wolves centered their attention on the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">93</a></span>
main issue and waited only for an opening.
Shady and the restless coyotes out in the sage
were forgotten, each wolf conscious only of
his foe. Those others mattered not at all,
for there were certain known laws which all
past experience had proved unalterable. She-wolves
showed small concern over the clashes
of rival males; coyotes never fought with
their big gray cousins, and there were no other
wolves about. The issue was squarely up
to them.</p>

<p>Each time that Breed appeared off guard for
a split second the gray wolf laid his ears, the
involuntary betrayal of muscles tensing for
the fatal spring; and Breed's own flattening
ears each time evidenced his readiness to
counter. Shady sensed the enmity between
them without knowing the inevitable result.
Her mode of fighting was the impulsive way
of the dog, the act almost simultaneous with
the desire, and this protracted, cold-blooded
calculation was new to her.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">94</a></span></p>

<p>Breed gave an opening at last, turning and
reaching for a bite of meat, and exposing the
unprotected side of his neck. Flatear struck
for it without a sound, driving straight across
the steer with all his weight behind the gleaming
rows of teeth. Breed dropped flat and
as his enemy swept over him he swung his
head up and sidewise in a terrible slash that
tore an ugly rent in the gray wolf's paunch.
They whirled face to face,&mdash;and both were
treated to a series of tremendous surprises
which shattered all previous convictions.</p>

<p>Shady harked back to the ways of her
domestic ancestors, to the custom of dashing
into a neighborhood dog fight and mauling
the one strange dog in the lot, regardless of
sex,&mdash;and Breed had been her friend long before
he had become her mate. Flatear was the
one strange dog to Shady, and he found himself
assailed by a screeching fury who fought
without care or caution, her sole aim being
to sink her teeth in any available part of him.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">95</a></span>
As he leaped away from this unnatural she-wolf
he was met by a second surprise. The
coyote pack had learned to strike when the
leader struck. Peg flashed round a sage and
laid open his flank, and as he whirled to face
this new enemy Cripp slashed him from
behind. Three coyotes darted past Breed
and before he had recovered from the shock
of the surprise his enemy had fled.</p>

<p>Flatear did not flee from fear but from an
overwhelming sense of the whole world gone
mad, the shattering of tradition and the overthrow
of natural laws. The chaos in his
mind sent him flying from this insane place
within six seconds after his first attack. A
mating she-wolf had been transformed into
a she-fiend and in the same second he had
been mobbed by coyotes. No doubt he
believed with Collins that strange things had
come to pass of late in the ranks of the coyote
tribe. Flatear headed back for the hills out
of which he had come, and as he ran his<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">96</a></span>
bewilderment crystallized into a consuming
hatred for the strange yellow wolf, the
hybrid beast who had upset the established
order of things. He did not know that Breed
himself had been so nearly paralyzed with
sheer astonishment that he had not joined
the attack.</p>

<p>The coyotes settled once more to the enjoyment
of their interrupted banquet. Breed
little realized that he had made a mortal
enemy, one who would not merely attempt
to deprive him of his mate during the running
moon as would any other unattached dog wolf,
but one whose enmity was for the individual
and who had marked him for the slaughter
when next they met, regardless of time or
season.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">97</a></span></p>
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_V" id="CHAPTER_V"></a>CHAPTER V</h2>


<p>The number of coyotes in Collins' territory
had been cut down by half and only the wisest
were left. As they grew more trap-wise the
wolfer increased the cunning of his sets.
Clearly marked cow trails crossed through
every low saddle in the foothills and Collins
studded these with traps. After once his
scent was cold the coyotes had nothing to
warn them of these sets, but trail trapping
is largely chance and not productive of great
results.</p>

<p>Breed saw one coyote in a trail trap and he
forswore the following of cow trails. The
coyotes soon learned to avoid them. Collins
noted the absence of coyote tracks on trails
that had once been padded thick with them
and the wolfer chuckled over this evidence
of their resourcefulness.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">98</a></span></p>

<p>Some of Breed's pack had fallen victims
to the trap line but their places had been
filled by new recruits, every one trap-wise
to the last degree. But even these found it
increasingly difficult to retain their lives.</p>

<p>A new menace hovered over every coyote
that ranged near the foot of the Hardpan
Spur, a menace that filled the hardiest prairie
wolf with dread. Many a lone coyote was
suddenly startled by a huge shape that leaped
for him and bore him down. None thus
attacked lived to spread the warning and the
only knowledge the others had of the lurking
fiend was the finding of old friends, stiff and
dead, their throats gashed open by savage
teeth. The tracks and scent round these
murder spots identified the slayer.</p>

<p>Flatear spent his days high in the hills and
at night he dropped to the low country to
perpetrate his unnatural crimes. Coyotes
had violated the customs of centuries and
turned their teeth against him. He now<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">99</a></span>
wreaked vengeance for this affront. There
were no wolves to answer his call, so Flatear
no longer howled, but prowled the range
without a sound to warn prospective victims,
a silent assassin that struck without notice.</p>

<p>At the end of a week he had left a long trail
of victims behind but not one of Breed's pack
was among them. Those that had pack-hunted
with the yellow wolf and learned the
advantages of combined attack in killing
heavy game now put that same knowledge
to good use for their own protection, sufficient
evidence of the quick adaptability with which
coyotes rise to meet any new emergency.</p>

<p>Mated pairs now ran close when hunting,
sometimes traveling in fours. Flatear soon
discovered that the teamwork of a pair of
fighting coyotes was more than a match for
even his great prowess and his kills grew fewer.</p>

<p>Cold fear clutched every coyote that caught
a fugitive scent of the gray killer, but Breed
did not share this dread. He was Flatear's<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">100</a></span>
match in size and strength and so was not
concerned. Breed could not know that Flatear's
hatred had become almost an obsession;
that night after night the slayer was craftily
trailing him and that killing coyotes was but
a side line to lighten the hours of a protracted
stalk for Breed himself. Flatear was a
veteran warrior and he waited only for an
opportunity to attack when he should find
Breed alone. Nose and ears kept him apprised
of the yellow wolf's whereabouts, but
usually there were coyotes running with him
and invariably the tracks of the she-fury were
mingled with those of her mate. Breed was
untroubled by any thought that sudden death
lurked in wait for him the first time he should
run alone through the sage.</p>

<p>While Flatear plied his bloody trade and
made the nights fearsome for the coyotes,
men found one more method of harrying
them by day.</p>

<p>The first Breed knew of this danger was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">101</a></span>
one day when he lay with Shady on a high
point of ground. There were many things
about Shady which he could not fathom.
From the first he had found much of mystery
in her. She insisted on traveling in broad
daylight whenever the notion seized her and
she seemed not to share his fear of horsemen,
often rising incautiously from her bed for
a better view of them, careless of the risk of
their seeing her.</p>

<p>Shady cocked her ears alertly at a distant
sound, and the same note, faint as it was,
roused Breed from his nap. Somewhere off
across the foothills several men had raised
their voices in a wild outburst of cheers.
This sounded again and again, each time
from a point nearer to where Breed lay. A
band of antelope sped past without following
their usual custom of stopping to look back.
Breed caught the vibrations of pounding hoofs,
the sound of many hard-running horses
blended in one. Through it all he heard an<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">102</a></span>
occasional note that was strange to him, a
shrill, sharp note that had something of the
wolf in it, yet which he knew was not made by
any beast he had met before. And at this
note Shady laid her ears and growled.</p>

<p>The cheers and the hammering hoofs came
closer and Breed fixed his eyes on the edge
of the flat bench spread out for half a mile
before him. A coyote spurted from the
mouth of a draw off to the left of Breed's
position and raced across the flat. He was
stretched out and running his best, but before
he had covered two hundred yards five great
wolfhounds poured out of the draw. They
were slender and long-coupled, capable of
tremendous speed, and before the coyote
passed below Breed the lead dog was but
a few lengths behind.</p>

<p>For the most part the dogs ran silently
and wasted no breath in senseless clamor,
but occasionally one of them loosed an eager
yelp, the sound as thin and keen as his body.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">103</a></span>
A dozen riders streamed across the flat on
furiously running horses, cheering as they
came. The coyote doubled to evade the
snapping jaws of the foremost dog, and as
he turned another struck him. He rolled
over twice, and when he gained his feet he
faced his enemies. He knew the game was
up but he went down fighting,&mdash;fighting
against odds without a whine; and Breed
watched five savage dogs mauling a limp dead
thing that ten seconds past had been his
valued friend. These strange beasts did not
move off as the men rode up, and Breed
realized with a shock that the men did not
ride with the purpose of killing them; that
they were leagued together and that the dogs
were the creatures of men the same as sheep
and cows were their property.</p>

<p>He stole down the far slope, keeping the
high ground between himself and the horsemen.
Shady followed him closely, moving
furtively and with many backward glances,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">104</a></span>
her tail tucked almost between her legs, and
Breed, accustomed to Shady's indifference
to the approach of riders, wondered at this
sudden reversal of her usual ways.</p>

<p>But it was not the men that roused Shady's
fear; above all other things she feared and
hated dogs. The few that had followed their
masters to Collins' house had always sensed
the wild blood in her, and at the first opportunity
they had pounced on her with intent
to kill. Shady had found friends among the
coyotes and had found only hostility among
dogs. Savagery is only relative, according
to the views of the one who pronounces upon
it, and from Shady's experience she was
right in her judgment that the ultimate limit
of savagery was reached only in the dog.</p>

<p>The owner of the dog pack lived some ten
miles from Collins and the whole countryside
had assembled to witness the first race.
There were fewer riders in each chase as the
novelty wore off but the days were few when<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">105</a></span>
the owner failed to take the dogs out for a run.
Wolfhounds run only by sight and coyotes
are slippery prey, doubling and twisting on
their trails to throw their pursuers off, so the
result was always in doubt and every chase
did not yield a coyote pelt.</p>

<p>After that first day Breed did not wait for
the dogs to draw near but started off the
instant he found that they were coming his
way. It was Shady's habit of daylight traveling
that led Breed into grave danger within
a week after the dog pack had made their
first run. He followed Shady down the bed
of a gulch which screened their movements
from prying eyes but at the same time served
to shut out all the various signs by which
Breed received long-range warnings. As
they loitered along the bottom of the draw
the antelope bands were flashing the danger
sign; range cows on the ridges all stood
facing the same way; everywhere coyotes
were scurrying for cover, but all these things<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">106</a></span>
passed over Breed's head. A coyote flipped
into the gulch and he did not tarry but passed
Breed with merely a sidelong look and
vanished round a bend.</p>

<p>Breed was instantly alert. He darted to
the rim of the draw and looked warily about
him. There was not an antelope in sight
and no cows grazed in the little basin that
flanked the gulch at the point where he left
it; not a sign to warn him of the source of
the danger. He ran for the crest of a ridge
for a better view,&mdash;and the next instant he
was in full flight back the way he had come,
for as he sky-lined himself on the ridge five
sharp-eyed wolfhounds a quarter of a mile
away had darted toward him. He knew that
they had seen him and were coming, that
death was sweeping down on him.</p>

<p>He turned up the gulch and followed it
toward the hills, Shady running her best to
keep up with him. The dogs fanned out to
look for him as they topped the ridge. The<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">107</a></span>
upper end of the draw widened to blend into
a broad mesa and the hounds caught sight
of the two wolves as they headed out across
the flat. Breed had held his lead but a clean
race of over a mile confronted him, the flat
affording not one shred of cover. He swung
his head slightly to one side as he ran, one
backward-rolling eye taking in every detail
of what transpired behind him.</p>

<p>He saw the five specks increase their speed
and knew that they had sighted him again;
they angled slightly and he watched them
draw gradually together, their courses converging
on the center of his line of flight till
they were once more running well bunched,&mdash;and
gaining.</p>

<p>His lead was being steadily cut down, the
gap perceptibly lessened; the specks showed
larger with every backward glance till every
dog was clearly visible. Shady was fleet but
her speed was no match for Breed's and he
would not leave her. The high-pitched<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">108</a></span>
sinister yelps sounded from behind him as
the eager dogs closed up, putting forth every
effort to end the race before the wolves reached
the choppy badland breaks at the far edge
of the flat. Shady's pace was lagging, and
they gained the first gulch of the broken
country a bare fifty yards ahead of the leading
hound.</p>

<p>The gulch feathered out into a maze of
branching draws and Shady lost Breed on
the first sharp turn and ran on alone while
the dogs streamed past after the yellow wolf.</p>

<p>Breed slowed his pace, fear for Shady's
life surmounting even the fear for his own,
but as the lead dog flashed into view without
any sound of a fight behind him, Breed knew
that his mate was safe and he turned on the
reserve speed he had not been free to use
while she ran with him.</p>

<p>The country ahead was a tangle of small
flat-tops, crisscrossed by a network of badland
washes and cut-bank draws, and for two<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">109</a></span>
miles he eluded the dog pack by sheer brainwork
and cunning. But the hounds pressed
him hard. Their speed was greater than his
own and each time they lost sight of him
they spread out both ways. Whenever he
crossed a flat-top bench some one of them
always sighted him and bored straight for
the spot, and his team-mates, noting this
sudden burst of speed, wheeled as one and
fell in behind him.</p>

<p>Breed's one aim was to reach the hills,
knowing that once among the trees he could
shake them off. His course led him ever
nearer to the base of the spur but he knew
at last that he could not make his goal. His
muscles had lost their spring and his breath
came in leaky gasps; the dogs would pull
him down on the first sagebrush slopes of the
hills before he could gain the shelter of the
trees.</p>

<p>He broke cover and started up the last long
sloping bench that led to the base of the spur.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">110</a></span>
The mouth of every gulch behind him seemed
to belch forth a dog and they raced across
the bench, spread out for two hundred yards.</p>

<p>Then Breed sprung one last desperate trick,&mdash;a
coyote trick. A badland wash intersected
the flat squarely across his route and
Breed leaped to the bed of it and fled fifty
yards along its course, then flashed into a
narrow coulee that led straight back toward
the dogs. The draw was shallow, with
scarcely sufficient depth to cover him, but
the dogs did not suspect and as they darted
on ahead Breed doubled back through the
very center of the pack. He ran with the
last of his strength, crept from the sheltering
coulee and leaped into the center of a heavy
clump of sage where he crouched flat and
peered out at the puzzled dogs. Of all the
beasts there are but few with the brains to
plan such a coup and the nerve to carry it
through when winded and played out,&mdash;and
with certain death the penalty for a single<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">111</a></span>
slip. The ruse would not have fooled a trail
hound for an instant, but with sight-hunting
coursers it worked.</p>

<p>Breed watched the dogs swing wide and
scour the country off to the right of him till
they appeared as swift-skimming dots in the
distance. Then one of them lined out with
increased speed as he topped a ridge. One
after another Breed saw them flash over the
skyline and disappear.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">112</a></span></p>
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VI" id="CHAPTER_VI"></a>CHAPTER VI</h2>


<p>Shady's first impression after taking the
wrong turn in the coulee was one of vast
relief at having evaded the dogs. The recovery
of her breath was accompanied by a
vague sense of loss which rapidly deepened
into an ache of loneliness so oppressive that
her whole spirit was weighed down by it.
She started up through the long crescent-shaped
neck of badlands that partially encircled
Collins' cabin and extended clear to
the foot of the spur, knowing that this was
Breed's favorite route when making for the
hills. She moved slowly and with many
halts, cocking her head sidewise and tilting
her ears for some sound of her mate. She
came out into a funnel-shaped basin that
sloped down from the first sharp rise of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">113</a></span>
spur. The small end of it formed a saddle
between two knobs, leading to Collins' shack
as through a natural gateway.</p>

<p>Shady trotted to the saddle and gazed down
at the wolfer's cabin five hundred yards away,
the spot which had meant home to her over
the greatest part of her life. The door stood
invitingly open. She turned and saw the
five dogs pouring down the funnel of the
basin. The sudden purposeful increase of
speed which Breed had noticed as the dogs
left his field of view had been occasioned by
the sight of Shady standing in the notch.</p>

<p>Without an instant's hesitation Shady
headed straight for that open door, a haven
of refuge which had served her well in the past
when assailed by the dogs of visiting ranchers.
The dogs were jaded and Shady was fresh,
and she reached her goal without their gaining
an inch.</p>

<p>Collins sat smoking his pipe when he was
startled by the frenzied entrance of his former<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">114</a></span>
pet. Shady failed to pause for greetings but
made one mad leap from the door and slid
to the farthest corner under the wolfer's bunk.</p>

<p>Collins grunted with surprise and for a space
of five seconds his brain refused to function
with its usual snap. Then he rose and crossed
to the door to discover the reason for Shady's
headlong <a name="home_coming" id="home_coming">home-coming</a>,&mdash;and slammed it
shut with but a single second to spare.</p>

<p>One dog rose on his hind feet, standing
higher than a man, and savagely raked the
door from top to bottom with his claws while
another opened his jaws wide and closed them,
his teeth splintering across the smooth surface
as he sought to gnaw his way inside. The
remaining three circled the cabin, sniffing
explosively at the cracks between the logs.
Shady was seized with a fit of excessive
shivering induced by these dread sounds, and
Collins heard her hind leg-joints beating
a spasmodic tattoo on the cabin floor. Then
he turned on his ready grin.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">115</a></span></p>

<p>"Just one split second more," he said,
"and they'd have surged in here and wrecked
this plant for fair,&mdash;and that's a fact!"</p>

<p>That night when Breed sent out his call
for Shady there was no answering cry. He
called again and again, an agony of longing
and entreaty in his tones. A sickening dread
entered his soul,&mdash;the fear that his mate
had been caught in a trap, shot by some rider
or killed in some other way by man. He
little suspected that Shady was at that instant
resting her head on a man's knee and
enjoying the feel of his fingers scratching
behind her ears.</p>

<p>"Good old Shady," Collins said, roughing
her head between his hands. "You're a
renegade now, old girl,&mdash;a she-outlaw, that's
what you are. You've gone over to the wild
bunch, and men will be out after your scalp;
and they'll get it too. You'll go ambling
up to some man and he'll blow you up.
You won't stick with me now unless I keep<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">116</a></span>
you chained. You'll go back to 'em,&mdash;and
if you're lucky you may go right on living
for mebbe a month. You don't know the
ropes out there and they'll pick you up."</p>

<p>Shady suddenly stiffened at Breed's first
cry.</p>

<p>"Don't need to be afraid of that," Collins
assured her. "That's old Breed. He won't
bother you. It must be hell, Shady, to be
born astraddle of a fence like you, afraid of
tame dogs and the wild bunch too."</p>

<p>Breed howled again and Shady moved to the
door and whined, scratching and sniffing along
the crack. Her uneasiness increased with
every howl. She clawed so vigorously at
the door that it rattled on the hinges; then
her pent-up emotions sought partial relief
in action and she ran in crazy circles about the
cabin, weaving in and out among the furniture
at top speed, running over and under
the bunk and leaping over chairs, then brought
up in front of Collins and gazed pleadingly<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">117</a></span>
up into his face. The Coyote Prophet regarded
her speculatively.</p>

<p>"I read you wrong, Shady," he said.
"You're not afraid of Breed&mdash;you want
to go to him, that's what; he's a friend of
yours. Surely now, an old savage like him
didn't go and take up with a little misfit like
you."</p>

<p>Breed's voice sounded again and Shady
raised her own, the whole cabin ringing with
her long-drawn howl. Up in the funnel basin
Breed had picked up her trail and was trying
to work it out from among the trails left by
the dogs. He stopped abruptly and listened.
A strange muffled sound had reached him,
hollow and drumlike, but there was a familiar
chord in it, and Breed swept ahead on Shady's
trail, his hope of finding her alive renewed.</p>

<p>"You're mated up with that yellow wolf,"
Collins stated. "Two freaks paired up! If
you track round with Breed you may live
longer than I thought. He'll show you how<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">118</a></span>
to beat the game." The Coyote Prophet
crossed to the door and opened it. "Go to it,
Pet," he said. "He's a-calling you." But
the last remark was addressed to a streak that
vanished into the night.</p>

<p>Shady met Breed in the notch and frisked
wildly around him. Breed's delight in this
reunion was as deep as hers but he was more
dignified and staid, his emotions less openly
apparent. All through the night Shady held
so close to him as to brush against him
frequently as they ran.</p>

<p>Shady rapidly absorbed much of Breed's
caution. Two days after their race with the
dogs Shady had occasion to revise her estimates
of horsemen. Twice in the same day,
after imprudently showing herself in the open,
she heard the vicious reports of their guns
and the balls tossed up spurts of earth about
her. Thereafter she followed Breed's lead
in all such cases. Breed's way was the wolf
way, recognizing no individuals among men<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">119</a></span>
but classing them as a dangerous whole.
Shady, having lived among them, knew them
as individuals, but this knowledge was soon
blurred and she too acquired the views of
the wild things toward men and lumped them
as a whole. There was but one reservation.
She placed Collins, the one man who had
been kind to her, in a class by himself.</p>

<p>This eccentricity was the source of much
worry to Breed. Shady could see no good
reason why she should not revisit Collins
when the mood so moved her. One night
she turned abruptly from her course and
headed for the twinkling lights of the wolfer's
cabin. Breed turned with her. Cripp and
Peg, each with his mate, ran on either flank.
The coyotes stopped two hundred yards from
the house but Shady held straight ahead.
Breed tried to dissuade her but to no avail.
He nipped her sharply, and its only effect
was to cause her to tuck her tail and spurt
for the house.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">120</a></span></p>

<p>Breed stopped twenty yards away, every
nerve quivering from excitement over this
suicidal move. He heard Shady scratch at
the door. It swung back and a flood of light
streamed out into the night. Breed heard
a man's voice booming out a welcome; saw
his mate jump up and put her paws against
him, their outlines framed in the lighted
doorway. Then the door closed and his mate
was inside with a man, the arch enemy of all
wolves. Breed whirled and fled. He ran
blindly and at high-pressure speed as if he
fled before an actual enemy. All his sense of
balance was thrown out of gear, the fitness
of things upset, and he felt his reason tottering.
For his ear, attuned to receive the meaning of
all animal sounds, could detect the least
tremor of menace in any animal note; when
a range bull bellowed Breed knew whether
the tones held invitation to his cows or
husked a warning to some intruder that had
strayed over into his chosen range. In any<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">121</a></span>
animal voice the quiver of anger or fear was
easily apparent to him; and there had been
no vibrations of anger in the man's tones, only
those of friendliness.</p>

<p>The coyotes were hard pressed to keep
abreast of him, and after a wild race of some
four miles he wheeled abruptly and retraced
his course, the longing for his mate combining
with curiosity to draw him irresistibly back
to the spot where this impossible thing had
transpired.</p>

<p>His pace slackened as he neared the house,
then increased as he heard Shady's voice.
Shady had met Breed in the notch after her
first visit to the cabin and she naturally
assumed that she would find him there again.
She repaired to the spot at once after leaving
the cabin and waited for him to come.</p>

<p>For three nights in succession Shady made
her pilgrimage to meet her one friend among
the world of men. Breed could not unravel
the mystery of these visits. He could only<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">122</a></span>
know the actual that reached him over the
trails of his physical senses. Sights, scents
and sounds were facts to him. Those senses
combined to show him that the unnatural
visits were real,&mdash;that Shady actually entered
the lair of a man and came back smelling
strong of him. Yet when she was with him
Breed felt a sense of unreality in his memories
of those visits, partaking of the same vague
qualities that dreams possessed for him after
waking.</p>

<p>But he fathomed it at last, evidence that
his brain came from his coyote mother, a
brain that is capable of constructive reasoning,
of taking two facts which the physical
senses have verified and evolving a third from
them,&mdash;the association of ideas.</p>

<p>His nose told him that there was something
in Shady's scent that was similar to that left
by the dog pack. His eyes had proved that
those dogs were the companions of men.
Eyes, ears and nose testified that Shady<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">123</a></span>
visited the haunts of men and was accepted
as a friend. His nose further told him that
Shady was half coyote, and her voice added
proof of this. From out this fragmentary
assortment of facts Breed found a satisfactory
answer. He knew that Shady was of the wild,
yet that she was also linked with the world
of men, thus combining two things which in
the past had seemed widely separate, a chasm
too wide to span, dividing the animals of the
wild from those belonging to man.</p>

<p>Each recurring visit confirmed this fact.
Shady missed two nights, but on the third
she headed for the cabin with the coming
of night. The comparative warmth of early
winter had given way to the gripping, penetrating
cold of January. Breed's appetite
increased with a corresponding drop in temperature
and he was hungry. But from
Shady's actions he knew that she was seized
with one of those queer lapses which called
her back to former ways and he delayed the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">124</a></span>
hunt until she should return from this trip.
The coyotes had all mated and the season
for pack-hunting was past, yet many of them
still rallied to his call; but on this night he
lingered in the notch and waited for Shady to
come back to him before summoning the pack.</p>

<p>He prowled uneasily about the narrow
saddle, and in his nervousness over Shady's
protracted absence he forgot the danger of
following cow trails and padded restlessly up
and down those which threaded through the
gap. And as he waited for her a mortal enemy
found the chance he had sought so long and
began stalking him from behind.</p>

<p>Flatear dropped from the hills to follow
his ruthless trade and as he swung down the
funnel basin Breed's scent was wafted to his
nose. The breeze held up the slope,&mdash;he
had the wind on the yellow wolf. He shifted
across the wind but it carried no coyote scent.
His victim was alone. Flatear followed up
the drifting current of scent and sighted Breed<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">125</a></span>
at a hundred yards. His feet made no sound
and the wind held right; the breed-wolf was
unaware of his approach.</p>

<p>Breed saw a sudden flow of light from the
cabin and knew that Shady was leaving it to
come back to him. He sent forth the rally
call to the pack and turned to trot along a cow
trail. He gave a sudden mighty leap into
the air and crashed down four feet away as
he struck the end of the chain swiveled to
the trap that had crushed his foot.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">126</a></span></p>
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VII" id="CHAPTER_VII"></a>CHAPTER VII</h2>


<p>Breed's great paw had not squarely centered
the trap and the jaws clamped on but
two toes. He fought the trap with all his
strength, backing up to gain slack in the
chain, then throwing all his weight and force
into his spring as he launched himself into
the air, only to be jerked violently to the
ground at the end of the chain.</p>

<p>Four times he sprang, and four times the
breath was almost jarred from his body
as he smashed down on his side. As he
rose from the last spring he suddenly stiffened,
standing rigidly in one spot while every
hair rose along his spine. Twenty feet away
a great gray shape loomed in the sage.
Breed knew it was the midnight killer who
had left such sinister evidence of his handiwork<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">127</a></span>
scattered along the foot of the hills,&mdash;and
there was no doubt of his purpose. The
yellow wolf was handicapped and knew that
he had no chance, but he did not storm and
rage aloud as a dog would have done; his
was the coyote way. He backed up inch by
inch till he stood above the trap stake, and
this move gave him a four-foot striking
range each way.</p>

<p>Flatear did not fear traps with the full
knowledge of their powers and limitations
as the coyotes did, but with the superstitious
dread of the wolf. In common with
all his kind he had merely avoided instead of
investigating this danger, and now his understanding
could not distinguish between a
trap that was set and one that was sprung
and harmless.</p>

<p>The clank of the trap chain delayed his
attack. He feared that the thing which
clamped his enemy's foot might leap out and
seize his own. The killer circled his victim,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">128</a></span>
and the yellow wolf turned round and round
in the same spot, keeping his bared fangs
toward his foe. The trap chain kinked and
twisted till it gave him less than a foot of
play. Only his insane hatred of Breed led
Flatear to brave his horror of that sound of
grating steel,&mdash;but he came in close at last,
crouched and sprang. Breed leaned sharply
to one side and met him with a side slash of
teeth but the weight of his enemy threw him
and he felt the killer's teeth cut cleanly into
his shoulder and slide along the bone. Flatear
reversed his snap so swiftly that it seemed
but a double swing of his head, yet the second
swing drove his teeth along Breed's neck and
laid open a six-inch gash. As Breed struggled
to his feet the wolf's fangs sliced at his throat
and ripped it open but not deep enough to
kill. A loop of the kinked trap chain was
tightened on Flatear's toes by Breed's convulsive
backward dodge, and a ghastly fear
that he himself was trapped swept through<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">129</a></span>
him, transcending even the lust to kill the
yellow wolf. He made one wild leap for
safety,&mdash;and the tightening kink cracked
his toes and threw him, the same lurch dragging
Breed down with him, and they rolled
into a furious tangle of clashing teeth and
rattling steel.</p>

<p>Out in the night the coyotes were moving
in from all directions in answer to the call
Breed had sent out ten seconds before the
steel jaws gripped him. Shady was trotting
leisurely up to the saddle to meet her lord
and mate,&mdash;the mate whose life was flowing
out through a score of ugly rents. Breed's
strength was ebbing fast, and he no longer
had the power to put killing force behind his
teeth. Flatear snapped aimlessly, his mind
half crazed by that fearsome pinching of the
chain on his toes. He felt it loosen and slip
off, and he leaped clear of the spot.</p>

<p>A shape moved over the edge of the saddle
and the next instant Shady drove straight<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">130</a></span>
at the gray assassin, raging as she came, the
dog in her boiling to the surface. Before she
reached him a yellow streak split the night
and Peg's teeth crunched on the wolf's hind
leg, the little coyote's deadly silence contrasting
queerly with Shady's fighting shrieks.</p>

<p>The big wolf fled from this combined attack,
one hind leg sagging as he ran, the
muscle torn raggedly across by Peg's one
snap. Once more Breed was indebted to
Shady and his coyote followers.</p>

<p>But Breed was far gone. He struggled
to rise but fell back again and lay still, the
blood oozing from the rents in his tattered
pelt. He raised his head and looked at
Shady, and for a single instant his mouth
opened and his red tongue lolled out in
friendly greeting, showing his spirit still
intact even though his body was slit in
ribbons; then he lowered it flat between his
paws and moved nothing but his eyes.</p>

<p>Shady crept close to him and licked his<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">131</a></span>
wounds. The coyote pack came up in pairs
and circled about their stricken leader, some
of them squatting on their haunches as they
regarded his plight, others moving restlessly
about; all of them silent as the grave,
the only sound in the notch being Shady's
continuous low wails as she implored her
mate to rise and follow her.</p>

<p>The bitter frost claimed Breed's swollen
foot and stiffened it, numbing all sense of
pain. He felt comfortable and content.
Then Peg moved up and sniffed critically
at the trapped foot. He set his teeth in it
but Breed did not flinch. The three-legged
coyote crouched beside him and turned his
head sidewise, the right side of his jaws flat
on the trap, his teeth sliding along the cold
steel and shearing away the frozen flesh.
The leg was dulled to all sensations and Breed
felt no pain. Shady viewed this amputation
closely and whined with anxiety as it
proceeded. Peg sliced the meat from the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">132</a></span>
two toes, set his teeth firmly across the bones
and crunched just once. Then he hooked
one forepaw over the trap and scratched it
away from Breed's sprawling hind leg, two
severed toes remaining in the trap.</p>

<p>Peg's lips and gums along the right side
of his face were seared and burned from
contact with the chilled steel of the trap,
raw patches of flesh showing where the skin
had adhered to the frosted springs and had
been wrenched loose. He nursed these
wounds with his hot tongue, and fiery twinges
of pain racked him but he did not whine. He
curled up and slept for an hour, then rose
and nipped Breed's flank. The cold had
stopped the flow of blood from Breed's cuts
and the pain of the nip roused him from the
stupor. He struggled to his feet and stood
swaying while Shady bounced around him
with joyous yelps. Then he set off for the
hills, moving at a walk, with his head drooping
weakly.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">133</a></span></p>

<p>The next morning Collins stood and looked
down at the two great toes in the trap.</p>

<p>"Pegged him," he said. "Pegged old
Breed. He'll be minus two hind toes from
now on out&mdash;but he could lose two toes
off each foot and still beat the game. The
whole coyote tribe must have been up here to
look him over from the number of tracks."</p>

<p>When Collins returned to his shack he
found six stockmen awaiting him. The
stampede of the sheep and the big kill made
by Breed's pack up in the hills had enraged
the sheepmen. They had confidently expected
that some man would collect Breed's
scalp on a fresh tracking snow, but while
every rider had scoured the foothills for
Breed's tracks after every storm, no man had
cut his trail. After gorging on warm meat
at night a wolf runs sluggishly the following
day; his muscles lack snap and his wind is
leaky, and a good horse can wear him down.
Twice in his first year Breed had been harried<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">134</a></span>
far across the foothills by hard-running horses,
and now the first spitting flakes of a coming
storm brought recollections of those desperate
races and roused his uneasiness to such a
pitch that he set off for the hills and remained
there till the wind had piled the snow and
cleared long stretches which made tracking
from a running horse impossible.</p>

<p>The sheepmen at the cabin informed Collins
of the big killing and their tale was punctuated
by every possible epithet applicable
to the coyote tribe. Collins, owning no
sheep, was in a position to view the killing
in a more philosophical light than they.</p>

<p>"You can't rightly blame 'em," he said.
"Men raise up sheep to kill 'em in cold
blood; coyotes kill 'em when they're hungry.
Two sides to it, 'cording to whether
you're a coyote or a man."</p>

<p>The stockmen stated the purpose of their
visit. Their association had raised the
bounties, making it profitable for wolfers to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">135</a></span>
hunt even in the summer months when
pelts were unprime and valueless; the price
for spring pups had been raised to equal the
reward posted for adults; and now the association
would furnish free poison for all
wolfers and advocated its use all through the
year. They stated their belief that this system,
if followed ruthlessly, would result
in the practical extermination of prairie
wolves. They rested their case and anxiously
awaited the Coyote Prophet's verdict
on their plan. Collins shook his head.</p>

<p>"Part of it's good," he told them, "and
part of it's dead wrong. Anyhow you can't
kill 'em all. I've told you so for twenty
year and I stand on what I've said. There'll
be a million coyotes left to howl when the
last man dies. The raise on summer bounties
is a good move&mdash;a man can afford to kill
shedders at that price; and the pup bounty
will set men to digging out their dens. But
your main plan was laid out by men that don't<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">136</a></span>
savvy the coyote mind." Collins leaned forward
and tapped one forefinger in the open
palm of his other hand to emphasize his
point.</p>

<p>"You let this all-year poison idea slide!
You mark me&mdash;if you try that on you'll
lose; more ways than one. I know 'em!
A coyote will take a chance on guns and
traps, but he's superstitious about these
strychnine baits. After a few turn up on the
range with a dose of it the rest will quit your
line. Your traps won't show one catch.
There's only one time to use it and that's
after you've bait trapped and trail trapped
till only the wisest are left. Then shoot
the whole range full of poison; get it all
out at once and knock off all you can. Then
take your poison up and quit! You hear
me,&mdash;quit! Then they'll sort of halfway
forget before another year and you can spring
it again. But I'm a-telling you the facts,&mdash;if
you leave poison scattered round loose for<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">137</a></span>
six months you'll see coyotes increasing fast
and there'll be hell to pay amongst your
sheep; you'll break behind two ways at
once. There'll be just enough that forget
themselves and take on a poison feed to
keep the rest in the notion of passing up all
dead meat. They won't even touch bloats
or winter-killed stock. When they're hungry
they'll make a kill,&mdash;and they'll work
on your sheep."</p>

<p>"I've stripped off three times more pelts
than any wolfer that's mixed poison with his
traps. Now my trap line is played out and
I'm going to throw poison into 'em for a
month,&mdash;and quit."</p>

<p>As Breed lay convalescing from his wounds
he reviewed the dangers of his chosen range,
not knowing that the one horror which he
feared more than all else combined was
about to sweep through the foothills. His
former attitude toward Flatear had been
one of aversion for his gruesome practices,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">138</a></span>
but with no touch of personal enmity. But
the gray wolf had not only pounced on him
at a season when mating was past and dog
wolves at peace, but had almost torn him to
shreds while he was helpless in the grip of a
trap. Breed now felt a terrible hatred growing
in him, a desire to kill the slinking gray
beast as soon as he gained sufficient strength
to take his trail.</p>

<p>Breed was too weak to hunt but there was
enough of the coyote in Shady to lead her to
rustle food for her mate. For five days
Breed lived wholly upon the chunks of meat
which Shady purloined from the frozen bait
piled against Collins' shack,&mdash;the meat which
he intended to poison and strew all across the
range as soon as he had finished taking up
his traps. On the sixth night Shady found
that the whole of the great stack of meat
had entirely vanished and near morning she
returned without food.</p>

<p>Breed's strength had flowed steadily back<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">139</a></span>
to him and he craved meat. By noon his
hunger was a hollow ache. Then suddenly
he knew that there was meat two miles west
of him. The wind was square at his back
so he could not possibly have scented it, and
any man who had seen him rise from his bed
and head for meat that lay two miles downwind
would have charged the act to that
mysterious intuitive knowledge that animals
are supposed to have.</p>

<p>There is one sure way by which men of
the open locate animal carcasses: the location
of winter-killed stock or range cows
mired down in an alkali bog is pointed out
to them at a distance of several miles. Game
wardens make use of it to locate the illegal
kills of poachers, and rangers to locate the
kills of cougars and wolves. In all countries
there are meat-eating birds and their flights
reveal much to practiced eyes.</p>

<p>Breed's mysterious information came from
seeing an eagle pitch down far to the west of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">140</a></span>
him. Two minutes later another swooped
from another angle. Ravens and magpies
winged toward the spot,&mdash;and Breed set
off at once toward the converging lines of
their flight. His hunger overcame his dislike
for daylight traveling, but he held to
high ground instead of the valleys.</p>

<p>He came to the edge of a shallow basin
devoid of all vegetation except an occasional
spear of grass, chalk-white patches on
the surface of the earth showing it to be an
alkali sink. A hundred yards beyond the
last tongue of sage that reached out into it
Breed could see a quarter of beef, two eagles
jealously guarding it. Magpies and ravens
flitted about, waiting for their share of the
feast. One of the eagles made frequent moves
to scatter them when they came too close,
rushing at them with a queer hopping run,
his wings half spread and trailing back.
Breed could plainly hear the snapping of his
powerful beak.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">141</a></span></p>

<p>The larger eagle suddenly took flight,
rising with awkwardly flapping wings and
cutting eccentric loops and curves, each dip
calling forth a raucous scream. He fought
his way to a height of two hundred yards,
then lost all muscular control and fell loosely
to the ground, his mate taking wing as he
smashed down on the flat.</p>

<p>A vague dread seized Breed. He watched
the magpies close in to the feed. A score of
them took the air at half-minute intervals,
fluttered wildly and with a spasmodic jerking
of their long tails and pitched down in
death. The rest of them left the meat.
Breed's mind again proved capable of associating
ideas, of constructing theories from
known facts. The birds had been alive.
There were no clanking traps or sound of gunshots
to account for it,&mdash;yet they had died.
Their crazy flappings had been in sharp contrast
to their usual grace when in the air.
Their actions had not been normal, and Breed<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">142</a></span>
someway thought of the ways of poisoned
coyotes. He had never seen a poisoned
horse or cow, or till now a poisoned bird,&mdash;had
always believed it an affliction of coyotes
alone; yet he felt the quickening of long
dormant fears. He knew that meat was
poisoned and he would not go near. He
drew farther back in the sage and rested till
night.</p>

<p>He started out with Shady at dusk and they
were joined by Peg and his mate, the four of
them hunting together. Peg killed a jack
and Breed's share of it partially satisfied the
gnawing of his hunger. As he traveled on
he sampled the wind for some sign of the
gray killer. It had narrowed down to a feud
between the yellow wolf and the gray, an
undying hatred, and whenever they next
met there would be one of them whose trail
the coyotes would never again cross on the
range.</p>

<p>Then all thought of hunger, all thought of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">143</a></span>
his feud with Flatear, everything but stark
horror was suddenly swept from Breed's
mind. A horrid, racheting cough sounded
from straight ahead. A coyote whisked into
the open and bounced toward them with
bucking leaps, strangling and gagging as he
came, then whirled and snapped at himself,
the froth dripping and foaming from his
jaws and the moonlight reflecting from his
set, staring eyes. They drew away from him
and he writhed on the ground in nasty convulsions,&mdash;stiffened
and stretched out with
his eyes bulging from their sockets and glaring
forth in death.</p>

<p>Breed headed for the hills and Shady and
the two coyotes clung close to his flanks, as
if numbers relieved the horror of the thing
they had just seen.</p>

<p>Three times before they reached the hills
they were terrified by the appearance of
former friends who had suddenly been
stricken into foaming maniacs. Breed<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">144</a></span>
turned on the first rise of the hills and howled.
The members of the coyote pack read the
message. Breed was bidding farewell to the
land of sage. Perhaps he knew that he would
never see the gray foothills again.</p>

<p>Six pairs of coyotes gathered toward his
cry. They had seen much and lived to pass
their knowledge on. Every one of them had
run the gauntlet of rifle fire; they had been
hounded by dogs. Most of them had been
maimed by traps,&mdash;and now this affliction
that turned coyotes mad with a single bite of
meat.</p>

<p>They followed Breed back into the hills,
a wise band, the pick of the coyote tribe and
well able to cope with new conditions and
teach their future pups the work of pioneering
in strange countries which lay ahead of
them.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VIII" id="CHAPTER_VIII"></a>CHAPTER VIII</h2>


<p>Breed found the hills buried deep under a
blanket of snow. In the low country the
drifts lay only in the gulches and the more
sheltered spots but up in the lodgepole valleys
and the heavy stands of spruce on the slopes
the white covering seemed endless and unbroken.
The dogs killed the meat for the
whole pack, for at this season the she-coyotes
were unfitted for the strenuous work of pulling
down heavy game. For the same reason
they were unable to travel long distances
in the snow. Breed too was disinclined to
move rapidly. His foot had healed but the
swollen leg was weak and tender. The pack
averaged less than twenty miles a day.</p>

<p>At the end of a week Breed's old home
was more than a hundred miles behind and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">146</a></span>
he was well up in the backbone of the hills.
He came out upon a mighty divide and gazed
off across a rolling country extending fifty
miles each way, all of it high but ringed in
by still more lofty ranges, their ragged saw-teeth
standing gaunt and grim against the
sky. There were broad, open meadows spread
out before him, great areas devoid of trees,
intersected by timbered ridges and rolling
parks where the stand of spruce was dotted.
The whole of it lay under a four-foot layer of
snow and gleamed dead white and lusterless,
but even so its aspect was more inviting
than the gloomy forest through which they
had come.</p>

<p>The open-loving coyotes elected to remain
in this land rather than penetrate the questionable
beyond. As they crossed the open
spaces the racy smell of the sage leaked
through the packed drifts underfoot and they
knew that parts of these valleys were carpeted
with the same brush that clothed the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">147</a></span>
foothills of their home land. This was the
summer range of the elk herds and once well
down the slope of the divide they found a
country that seemed devoid of game.</p>

<p>After advancing in loose formation for five
miles without any coyote finding a promising
trail, Breed caught a fugitive scent of meat.
He circled and looped, now catching it, then
losing it again. The broad valley stood white
and silent, gripped in a dead calm, and the few
vagrant breezes were imperceptible, merely
the sluggish drift of local air pockets that
shifted a few feet and settled.</p>

<p>The yellow specks that moved in pairs
far out across the snow fields slowed and
halted, changed their routes and headed
toward the leader who was questing about
with uplifted nose. Then Breed dropped
his head and ran with nose close to the
snow, twisting and turning in one locality
of less than a hundred yards in extent. The
eyes of every advancing coyote were fastened<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">148</a></span>
on Breed. They saw him stop abruptly
and shove his nose into the snow, and the
little puff of steam which rose around his
head as he breathed hard into the drift was
clearly visible to them all. They put on more
speed as he began to dig, and when the first
of them reached him they saw a tawny expanse
of elk hair at the bottom of the excavation.</p>

<p>They tore away the snow and uncovered
the whole carcass of a winter-killed elk that
had been refrigerating there for months.
Breed lingered near this spot for three days,
the coyotes bedding near by in pairs, and up
here where there were no men they fed in the
daytime whenever so inclined. There was
not an hour of the day or night when Breed
could not see one or more coyotes tearing at
the elk. When the last scrap of meat, hide
and hair had been devoured and the bones
gnawed white and clean, Breed moved on in
search of more.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">149</a></span></p>

<p>There were always some few stragglers
that lagged behind the elk herds and failed to
start for the winter range till after the passes
were blocked with snow. These turned back
and starved when the grass was buried deep
and their feet were cut and worn from pawing
through the crust to reach it; for the elk
is strictly a grazing animal and cannot live
entirely by browsing on the twigs and brush
as do moose and deer.</p>

<p>For a month Breed prowled this high
basin country, and in all that time his feet
never once touched earth except when crossing
some bald ridge from which the wind
had whittled the snow. His menu consisted
exclusively of frozen elk.</p>

<p>A chinook swept the hills and held for a
week, the hot wind melting and packing the
drifts and clearing the more exposed slopes
free of snow. The pack had split up and
scattered in pairs, each she-coyote selecting
some likely spot and remaining in that vicinity.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">150</a></span></p>

<p>The first day of the chinook every she-coyote
started her den, and the sites, though
widely separated, were identical in many
respects. Each chose a ridge with a southeast
exposure while higher ridges behind
cut off the sweep of the north and west winds;
and every den was located in a heavy clump of
sage. This latter feature was not for the
reason that sagebrush reminded them of
home, but because experience had proven
that the heaviest growths of sage were indicative
of deep, soft soil beneath and so pointed
to easy digging, a rule used not only by home-seeking
coyotes but by homesteading men
as well, and one that holds good throughout a
half-million square miles of sagebrush country.</p>

<p>Shady too had settled on an open ridge and
now spent much of her time there, but this
seemed more from a disinclination to travel
and a dislike of bedding in snow than from a
definite purpose of excavating a den. This<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">151</a></span>
puzzled Breed. Shady leaned more to the
casual dog way of trusting that a suitable
spot would present itself on the day when
her pups should arrive; yet there was enough
of the coyote in her to cause her to scratch
out a shallow nest in a sunny spot. This
act was more for present comfort, however,
than from any intent to make provision for
the future.</p>

<p>Peg and Cripp had always clung more
tenaciously to Breed than had the others of
the pack and Peg had settled on a ridge not
more than two miles away; but Cripp was
no longer to be found. It had been long
since his voice had been raised in answer to
Breed's call and he had not come back into
the hills with the coyote pack. Breed missed
the trusty follower who had run with him on
so many hunts, and day after day he expected
to catch a trace of Cripp in the wind
or to hear his friendly voice at night, but the
crippled coyote never came.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">152</a></span></p>

<p>Peg was now Breed's sole companion at
night, except when their mates joined them
at the two frozen elk carcasses in the bottoms
between their home ridges, and the two of
them explored the surrounding country together.
Peg's lips were scarred along the
right side of his face, the price of Breed's
liberty. There are close ties between animals,
a myriad proofs of friendships and
enmities, the same as among men, and it may
be that the act which had brought Peg those
honorable scars had helped to cement the
bond between himself and the yellow wolf.
Whether or not they had means of discussing
Cripp's absence, there can be no doubt that
they missed the genial old rogue that had been
their running mate for so many months and
that they wondered at his fate.</p>

<p>Breed visited Peg's home ridge during the
height of the chinook. Peg's mate was a
silky-haired coyote, her fur fluffy and long.
Fluff lay sprawled contentedly in the sunshine<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">153</a></span>
while her mate worked on the den.
She growled uneasily at Breed as he peered
down the hole. A shower of dirt greeted him
and he drew away as Peg backed from the
den and shook the dirt from his fur. Fluff
took her turn at the work but soon tired of
it, and Peg started in as soon as she left off.
A she-coyote picks her own den site and
starts the hole, but because she is easily exhausted
near denning time it falls to the
dog to complete the den.</p>

<p>When Breed returned to Shady he found
her scratching leisurely at the nest she had
scooped out. It was merely a raking of the
surface to loosen and soften the bed which
was smooth and glazed from her having
bedded there when her fur was wet; but
Breed read it as a tentative start toward
making a permanent home.</p>

<p>When Shady ceased her aimless scratching
Breed edged her aside and tore at the soft
earth with his paws. He had buried himself<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">154</a></span>
to the hips before he drew back. Shady
entered and critically inspected the hole,
then immediately backed out. That was the
extent of her interest. It may have occurred
to Breed that his mate's shifts at digging
were extremely brief, but nevertheless
he persisted till he had tunneled a curving
entrance eight feet long and hollowed out
a nest eighteen inches high by three feet
across. All well-ordered she-coyotes have
at least two, and the majority of them three
openings leading from their homes. Shady
failed to indicate the direction which she
wished these emergency tunnels to take so
Breed laid them out according to plans of
his own. By the time the den was completed
the chinook wind had cooled, and
winter tightened down over the hills once
more, freezing the surface dirt so solidly as
to make excavating impossible.</p>

<p>Breed repaired to the last frozen elk carcass
in his neighborhood and found Peg<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">155</a></span>
there before him. An hour later a she-coyote
came to the feed. She sprawled
flat in the snow and tore ravenously at the
frozen meat. Her eyes were hollowed from
hard journeying and lack of food. Breed
knew her for Cripp's mate and he momentarily
expected to see his friend. When her
hunger was appeased she faced back toward
the divide over which she had come and
howled; then, as if knowing her cry would
go unanswered, she turned and left them as
abruptly as she had come. She had no time
to lose and she could not dig a den, yet she
planned the best she knew. There would
be no mate to rustle food for her, and meat
would be the first essential while her pups
were young. Five miles beyond Breed's
home ridge she found an elk drifted deep
under the snow in the heavy timber. She
crawled into the heart of a windfall jam,
choosing one where the lay of the land would
prevent her being drowned out when the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">156</a></span>
drifts should melt, and stayed there till her
five pups were born.</p>

<p>When Breed returned home near morning
he heard queer squeals issuing from the
yawning mouth of the den. Shady's doglike
faith that a place would somehow be provided
for the great event had been justified
and she had taken possession of the den which
her wild mate had so carefully prepared.</p>

<p>Shady wandered no more with Breed, but
stayed at home in the den, and for the first
week all that Breed saw of her was a brief
glimpse of her nose as she came to the mouth
of the hole, seized the elk meat which he
brought as an offering and backed down out
of sight with it. After that he occasionally
saw the whole of her but these views were
hasty. Whenever Shady emerged from the
den her tail barely cleared the mouth of it
before she twisted back and dived headlong
from sight, panic-stricken lest some mishap
had befallen the pups during her long eight-foot<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">157</a></span>
trip from them to daylight. After two
days of hourly excursions of this sort she
spent a few moments outside the den, and
thereafter these periods were lengthened until
she remained on the warm slope fully as
much as in the den.</p>

<p>Night after night Breed heard the howls
of the lone she-coyote that had denned in the
windfall. Always she faced toward the land
that had been her home. A she-coyote
whose mate is killed after the running moon
will raise her pups alone and refuse to accept
another mate; yet the howls she sent
out were calls for a mate, and from this
Breed knew that she did not believe that Cripp
was dead. He pondered long over this mystery
of why Cripp still lived but did not join
his mate.</p>

<p>The supply of elk meat rapidly diminished
and at last was gone. The only carcass
Breed could locate within ten miles was the
one near the windfall, and the widowed<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">158</a></span>
mother defended that furiously against all
comers. The warm days of early March
had turned it stale and putrid but it was
all she had.</p>

<p>Every waking second of Breed's time was
spent on the meat trail. An occasional
blue grouse or snowshoe hare was the largest
game he found. That the coyotes were
faring as poorly he knew from the signs he
crossed each day in the hills. He found the
tracks of dog coyotes many miles from their
dens and always the signs showed that they
had been working out some cold rabbit trail.
Breed found the tracks of many bobcats in
the hills and these appeared to have been
wandering aimlessly. But Breed knew that
the noses of cat beasts are not keen enough to
work out any but the warmest trails; that
this accounted for his seldom finding signs
that a cat had trailed a rabbit, and that their
apparently crazy way of traveling was in
reality a systematic shifting across the air<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">159</a></span>
currents in search of the warm body scent of
their prey. Several times Breed picked up a
hot cat track and followed it at top speed but
the big bobs held mainly to the heavy timber
and always took refuge in a tree.</p>

<p>When Breed's pups were three weeks old
he had his first look at them when Shady
came from the den on a warm afternoon and
a swarm of fluffy little creatures toddled
after her. There were eight of them, all
with heavy frames that gave promise of their
attaining almost as great size as their father,
and there were strips of dark fur along their
backs. After that first trip they spent much
time romping and quarreling on the sunny
side hill.</p>

<p>A pair of golden eagles had nested on the
rough face of a pinnacle that rose from the
floor of the valley near its head, some five
miles from Breed's home ridge. These
mighty birds soared far out over the divide
and returned with meat for their fledglings<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">160</a></span>
in the nest. Their pealing screams often
split the silence of the valley. Shady paid
small heed to them but Breed often cast a
wary eye aloft when the screams sounded
from close at hand.</p>

<p>Shady was stretched comfortably before the
den one day, watching the pups scattered
out along the ridge, when she became aware
of a faint rushing sound such as the first
puffs of a fresh wind make when they strike
the trees some distance away. This increased
to a humming roar. She looked up
to see a huge shape driving down upon a pup
with incredible velocity, swooping at a sharp
angle, the great wings spread wide and hissing
through the air as the big bird tipped
dizzily from side to side. Within two seconds
after the first droning sound had reached
Shady's ears she saw the eagle strike his claws
through a pup and start up the valley on
lazily flapping wings. Shady raced madly
under him and raged until the valley echoed<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">161</a></span>
to her fury. Then she quieted and watched
till he was but a tiny speck off toward the
nesting peak, the dead pup dangling loosely
from the talons that had struck clear through
his slender body, the hind claw on each
foot meeting and interlocking with one front
claw in a grip which nothing short of the
actual severing of a leg tendon could break.</p>

<p>Thereafter Shady knew why Breed showed
uneasiness when an eagle screamed near the
den.</p>

<p>The pups knew every note of their mother's
voice and obeyed it implicitly. They
would be asleep in the den when a note would
summon them forth to play, every pup
tumbling hurriedly out; she would give
another cry when they were playing carelessly
in the open, the tone being so nearly identical
with that of the first that a man might hear
it a hundred times and detect no difference,
yet every pup would dive headlong for the
nearest hole.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">162</a></span></p>

<p>Shady learned to watch for the eagles.
Nearly always it was a shadow which warned
her first. She would see a swiftly moving
black speck gliding over the snow fields or
darting along the slopes of the ridges that
flanked the valley and she instantly issued a
warning to the pups, knowing that where
there was a shadow there must be a bird
above. Sometimes Breed saw the birds first
and called. Shady relayed the danger signal
to her young, and even if she was half a
mile away the pups made a prompt and
desperate spurt for the den.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">163</a></span></p>
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_IX" id="CHAPTER_IX"></a>CHAPTER IX</h2>


<p>The snow melted slowly in the high country
but by mid-April a few bare spots showed in
the more open meadows, the hardy mountain
grass sending forth green shoots. The rabbits
were drawn from the timbered ridges to
nibble these first spring dainties. The surface
of the drifts showed thousands of tiny mouse
tracks,&mdash;the mice that had lived deep under
the snow, subsisting on food previously stored,
now coming forth to swarm into these first
cleared patches.</p>

<p>The pups had grown large and strong and
were able to follow their parents on the meat
trail, and they soon learned to catch their own
mice. The drifts in the passes had packed
so firmly as to afford good footing and the
game was coming back to the summer range.
After the first few had made the crossing the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">164</a></span>
rest followed their trails and the main tide
of the elk migration set in, great droves of
cows boiling through all the passes and
streaming down into the green spots in the
meadows. There was now meat in plenty,
and the yelping barks of the cows sounded in
the valleys that had been wrapped in white
silence for so many months; but there was
not a sound from the bulls; the antlered
lords whose ringing challenges had filled the
whole expanse of the hills the previous fall
seemed voiceless now. These old fellows
had remained up among the high bald ridges,
their new antler growth tender in its velvet
sheath, and nothing would be heard from them
till after the porous growth had hardened
and their points were polished for the next
rutting time.</p>

<p>The wolf family returned to the den no
more, except perhaps for a casual inspection
when their wanderings chanced to lead them
to the neighborhood.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">165</a></span></p>

<p>The bears had come from their long sleep
and left the dens. There were black and
brown bears and monster grizzlies roaming
in the meadows. At first the diet of these
huge beasts consisted almost entirely of grass
and twigs but their appetites rapidly increased
and it was no unusual thing for a bear to
appropriate one of Breed's kills.</p>

<p>Breed did not fear bears, knowing that
their speed was less than his own and that they
were harmless so long as he did not molest
them and come into too close quarters. He
accepted this stealing of his meat as part of
the established order of things and always
moved away when a bear came swaying
leisurely up to his kill.</p>

<p>Shady, on the contrary, had a wholesome
fear of bears and was excited at their approach,
but at the same time she could not view their
thieving ways in such a philosophical light
and her resentment rankled deeper with each
recurring theft.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">166</a></span></p>

<p>The wolf family returned to a kill to find
a great silvertip feeding there. Shady's rage
boiled over and she swept down upon him
with a furious burst of barking. She would
have halted short of him but there was no
need. Breed was profoundly amazed to see
the mighty baldface flee down the slope with
Shady in full cry behind him.</p>

<p>Breed knew that bears did not fear him,
even though his fighting ability far surpassed
that of his mate, yet a grizzly fled at the first
sound of her voice. This deepened his respect
for Shady; the mate who was so helpless in
many respects was surprisingly resourceful
in others.</p>

<p>It was not known to Breed that bears had
learned to dread the bellowing of a pack of
trail hounds in the hills through knowledge
that men followed close behind, and that the
dog note in Shady's voice stirred up visions
of a man with a magazine gun on their trail.
But while the reason was not clear to Breed,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">167</a></span>
the fact that the mightiest grizzly took flight
before his mate was repeatedly proved to
him, and after once learning her power Shady
permitted no bear to deprive her family of its
meat.</p>

</div>

<p>As the summer advanced the pups learned
to pack-hunt with Breed. The coyote howls
at night were now confined to messages between
mate and mate or between mother and
pups. The life they led was essentially a
family life and they had no interests outside
of the family circle. Breed's cry to rally
a pack was never raised, for his own domestic
duties were many; and if he had sent forth
the summons none would have answered it.
He sometimes met Peg and ran with him for
a while, but these visits were infrequent and
brief, each having pressing business of his own.</p>

<p>Breed one day caught the scent of a coyote
upwind from him. This in itself was nothing
unusual but there was something vaguely
familiar about it, something that roused old<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">168</a></span>
memories, and suddenly he thought of Cripp.
He traced up the scent and as he topped the
ridge he stopped short and bared his teeth,
the hair rising along his spine. A horrid nightmare
of a thing rose from its bed and leered at
him. The hair had slipped from its body,
leaving the skin shiny and slate-blue. The
ears and head were furred, and the legs;
tufts of hair sprouted from the shoulders and
along the spine, but flanks and sides were
bare and the long tail was rat-like, its joints
showing through the tight-stretched skin.
The lips were drawn back and revealed the
blue gums receding from loosened teeth. This
was the result of poison that had failed to kill.</p>

<p>Breed knew this grisly apparition for Cripp.
The scent was there, and the warped foreleg.
Cripp did not recognize his friend. His
mind was clouded and the light of insanity
gleamed in his sunken eyes. Breed whirled
and fled, and a weird cry sounded behind
him,&mdash;the eerie howl of a maniac.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">169</a></span></p>

<p>All through the summer the coyotes shunned
the specter of living death that plodded
silently up and down the valleys and the
ridges. When it came suddenly through the
trees, drawn by the scent of a fresh kill, some
coyote family scattered swiftly and left the
feast. Cripp was as apt to howl in broad
daylight as at night, and the sounds were
meaningless, the unintelligible jargon of an
idiot. Every coyote within hearing bristled
with fear whenever Cripp's jabbering reached
their ears.</p>

<p>In the background of Breed's mind the
purpose to slay Flatear still persisted, but
his duties prevented his spending the time
to hunt for him. Occasional wolf howls were
heard back here in the hills, the calls of
strays that had drifted down from the north,
following the line of the hills and keeping well
back from the dangers of the low country.
Each time he heard the wolf note the urge
to kill was strengthened in Breed. He had<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">170</a></span>
heard Flatear's voice but once and so was
unable to identify him by ear alone but must
receive added testimony through eyes or nose.
Twice he left his family to investigate the
source of these cries. One came from a lone
female; the other from a big gray dog wolf
who had mated with a coyote, and there were
five pups trailing after the oddly assorted
pair. These pups were much like Breed's
own and they gave proof that the coyote
strain was stronger than the wolf. Their
language was that of their mother. The only
trace of wolf parentage was shown in their
greater size and the dark fur of their backs.
Breed's search for his old enemy proved fruitless.
Many things of which Breed was unaware
had taken place on his old home range
since he had left it, and Flatear, terrified by
the latest of these events, had slunk away to
the north.</p>

<p>Collins' prediction had been verified. The
coyotes in the low country where poison had<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">171</a></span>
been strewn broadcast on the range had
suddenly turned from stale meat as from
disease. Much of their food supply had
come from bloated sheep, from locoed horses,
and from cows that had eaten larkspur and
died, but they would no longer touch these
carcasses. Deprived of this source of food,
their kills became more frequent and they
grew bolder in their raids on calves and sheep.</p>

<p>Then a new and appalling menace reared its
ugly head in the foothills, striking not at
coyotes alone but at every living thing.
There were many coyotes such as Cripp,
with the hair slipped from their hides,&mdash;the
ones that had survived a dose of poison but
were unable to shake off its devastating after
effects. Hydrophobia broke out among these
and they ran amuck, striking alike at friends
and foes. Sound coyotes were turned into
frothing fiends that helped to spread the wave
of madness that swept across three States.
Horses and cows died by hundreds and it was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">172</a></span>
no unusual thing for one mad coyote to bite
fifty head of sheep in a single night. The
five dogs that had harried Breed were themselves
infected when they pulled down a mad
coyote, and they drove poisoned fangs into
forty head of stock before the last of the five
was run down and shot.</p>

<p>There was but one ray of hope in the whole
dangerous business and men seized on that.
Mad coyotes lost their cunning and ran
stupidly on some chosen course, biting every
living thing that crossed their trails, but
refusing to be turned aside even to avoid an
approaching man. Riders poured through
the foothills on fleet horses, shooting down
the stricken ones, all other business suspended
till this menace had been stamped out. And
through it all the ravages among the wily
coyotes were far less than among domestic
stock.</p>

<p>The spreading of coyotes over new territory,
which had been only gradual before, was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">173</a></span>
accelerated by the poison and madness that
had blighted the foothills. Thickly settled
districts far to the east, where coyotes had
formerly appeared but infrequently, were
now invaded by great numbers. Poison and
traps could not be used effectively against
them in localities where there were dogs on
every farm, and the coyotes were safer there
than on the open range. Reports that reached
Collins showed that for eight hundred miles
south along the base of the hills the coyotes
were quitting the flats and roaming through
the fastnesses of the Rockies.</p>

<p>Breed noted the steady flow of strange
coyotes into the high basins of his new range.
In the late summer his pups dropped one by
one from the family circle, going off on some
business of their own. During the latter part
of August Breed was conscious of a vague
sense of loneliness. This grew more pronounced
and then suddenly he knew! The
rally call for the pack rolled through the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">174</a></span>
valleys and echoed among the peaks, and
from far and near he heard familiar voices
raised in answer. The parental responsibilities
were over for one season, the pups
gone forth on their own, and the members
of the pack were free to follow the yellow wolf.</p>

<p>As Breed ran through the hills the pack
gathered, and each coyote fell into his old
place. Peg and his mate ran close on the
right of Breed,&mdash;but the place on the left
was vacant.</p>

<p>Cripp was coming, however. The cry for
the pack had penetrated the fog that obscured
his reason and touched a responsive chord
buried deep beneath. That cry was meant
for him. The coyotes made a kill and feasted,
but before their hunger had been satisfied
a living skeleton came moving toward them,
and they scattered wildly and left the meat
to Cripp.</p>

<p>Several strange coyotes joined Breed's pack
and these new members seemed possessed<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">175</a></span>
of some haunting fear. Breed noted their
constant air of expectancy and the intent
regard with which they favored every coyote
that drew near to them. They seemed always
suspicious that some friend would suddenly
turn upon them, and whenever some eager
coyote clashed his teeth while feeding, these
strangers that had come so recently from the
low country started uneasily at the sound.</p>

<p>Night after night Cripp followed the pack
and came to the kill. The coyotes all avoided
him but the strangers were assailed with a
ghastly dread of his grinning mask, and their
fears were communicated to the rest of the
pack. Breed himself caught it. An air of
tense watchfulness pervaded their gatherings,
a guarding against some menace as yet unknown
but which the actions of the strangers
indicated might be upon them at any moment.</p>

<p>After a week of this sort of thing Breed and
Shady were bedded on a ridge slope that
flanked a broad meadow when Breed saw<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">176</a></span>
a moving speck at the far edge of it. It
proved to be a coyote, though at first its
peculiar gait denied this. He came straight
on across the open, and Breed saw one of
his new friends trot from a willow clump in
the meadow, take one look at the advancing
stranger and become galvanized into a flitting
streak that left the valley. Even at that
distance his deadly fear was evident, and
Breed knew that the unknown danger had
become actual and was embodied in the queer-gaited
coyote that was coming toward him.</p>

<p>He ran with an automaton-like stiffness,
never changing his course, and occasionally
stumbling as if unaware of the character of
the ground over which he passed. His head
swung out slightly to either side and he
snapped each time. There was something
sinister in every move, as if his body was
driven on without conscious volition, actuated
by some dreadful, unclean force. Breed knew
it for some sort of poisoning, and his muscles<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">177</a></span>
bunched for flight. Shady barked angrily
as if to drive the thing away. Then Breed
saw a hairless travesty of a coyote move out
of a draw and halt directly in the path of the
mad coyote. Cripp stood there grinning
till he felt the other's teeth score his unprotected
hide; then he whirled and snapped
back at him. The mad coyote kept straight
on and Cripp followed at his own queer
shambling gait. He drew close and ran
alongside, and for a hundred yards they exchanged
slashes in a senseless sort of way.
Breed could see the blood oozing from the
fur of the mad coyote's neck, and the blobs
of white foam sliding down Cripp's shiny hide.
Then the mad coyote fell and Cripp kept on
for another ten yards before he missed him.
He wheeled and returned, stumbled and fell
and crawled back to his foe, and they lay
there toothing one another in an impersonal,
detached way, as if it did not matter.</p>

<p>Breed's soul revolted at this scene and he<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">178</a></span>
fled the spot. When he raised his howl that
night he was twenty miles farther north, but
the coyote pack answered from close at hand.
Many of them witnessed the same scene from
adjacent slopes of the valley. The others
had viewed similar sights, and there was a
general coyote movement north through the
mountains, a widespread exodus ahead of the
madness that was creeping up into the hills.</p>

<p>Breed had formerly been imbued with the
home-loving nature of the coyote, and this
had led him to restrict his wanderings to a
comparatively limited area instead of ranging
hundreds of miles in all directions after the
manner of wolves. This love of a permanent
home range now operated in a peculiar way.
All ties were severed behind him, the land he
loved bristling with such a wide variety of
dangers as to preclude all possibility of his
return. The wanderlust which now seized
him appeared a complete reversal of his
former desire to remain in one vicinity where<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">179</a></span>
every topographical feature was to him a
familiar landmark; but in reality this very
wanderlust was an expression of home love;
every step he took away from his old range
was unconsciously actuated by the desire
to find some new spot which would take the
place of the old.</p>

<p>For two weeks these wanderings were
erratic and uncontrolled by any conscious
purpose. He roamed on the Shoshone and
the Thoroughfare, the Yellowstone and the
Buffalo Fork of the Snake, then swung back
across the Sunlight Peaks. Shady had acted
queerly of late, frequently leaving Breed for
hours at a time and climbing to some commanding
point from which she would look
far off across the hills, as if seeking something
which was always just beyond the
range of her vision; but she always came
back to him. Breed found nothing out of
the way in this. Mated coyotes were prone
to follow separate trails for hours, even days,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">180</a></span>
and then meet again. Shady had clung to
him persistently, refusing to be out of his
sight except when at the den with her pups,
and this new manifestation seemed a natural
one to Breed, an evidence that his mate had
come to trust in her ability to shift for herself
in the wild. But it was not this. Now that
her pups had been schooled and sent out to
face the world alone, Shady hungered to see
the man who had raised her from a pup, and
to feel his fingers scratching behind her ears.</p>

<p>As the pack straggled out among the ragged
Sunlight Peaks Shady looked down across
the lower slopes; one valley opened into
another in an interminable procession and
far down across the spruce tops a rift between
two flanking hills afforded a view of the low
country, shimmering in the sun. Sand Coulee
Basin, her old home! And a variegated mass
in the distance marked the Rainbow Buttes,
rising isolated and alone from out the badlands.
Shady struck a swift gliding trot<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">181</a></span>
and dropped down the slope, disappearing
in the first twisted masses of <a name="timber_line" id="timber_line">timber-line</a>
spruce.</p>

<p>For the first few hours after her departure
Breed gave it no thought, but when she failed
to turn up he grew increasingly uneasy. Ten
hours and he called to her and there was no
reply, twelve and he circled to pick up her
trail but it had cooled. He prowled the peaks
for three days and nights, disconsolate and
lonely, even though in close touch with the
coyote pack, and sending out call after call
for his mate. Shady had spent the first two
days in almost continuous travel, put in a
single hour with the Coyote Prophet, reveling
in the feel of his exploring fingers and the
friendly sound of his voice; then she departed
as suddenly as she had come and spent two
more days in reaching the summit of the
Sunlight Peaks where she had left her mate,
for after all his hold on her was far more
gripping than that exercised by the man.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">182</a></span></p>

<p>She heard Breed's lonely cry and answered
it, and an hour later she was frisking about
him with doggish enthusiasm. The yellow
wolf accepted her lavish display of affection
with dignity; his joy in the reunion was
a match for her own, but the wolf in him was
unequal to matching the effusiveness of the
dog in her.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">183</a></span></p>
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_X" id="CHAPTER_X"></a>CHAPTER X</h2>


<p>All through the Yellowstone country the
evidence of Breed's teachings was apparent
on every hand. The progeny of the members
of his original band had been taught pack-hunting
by their parents, as they themselves
had learned the art from Breed. For a
hundred miles each way from Two Ocean
Pass the hills were full of the disciples of the
yellow wolf. The elk now fled from coyotes
as once they had fled from wolves. The
coyotes brought all their native trickery
and resourcefulness into play and made pack-hunting
a very different affair from that
practiced by timber wolves. They did not
hunt bunched, but scattered, saving their own
strength and wearing down that of their
prey. When an elk was singled out the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">184</a></span>
coyotes relayed him and kept him on the
move. Whenever he attempted a straightaway
flight some coyote flashed out in front
of him to turn him back, and he was headed
through bogs and spongy ground on the slides
at the foot of old snow drifts until his strength
was gone.</p>

<p>Breed's movements now lost their aimlessness,
and each day found him a few miles
farther north. The home love in him was
working, but he himself was unconscious of
the fact that he was seeking some land that
would answer all requirements. It was not
given to him to plan largely for the future,
and each move was occasioned by the dissatisfaction
with the country in which he
found himself, rather than from any definite
idea of mapping out a course for a permanent
range and there establishing his home.</p>

<p>Nevertheless he held steadily to the north
and the faithful pack moved with him.
Other coyotes flanked their line of march,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">185</a></span>
urged on by fear of the madness that lay
behind and finding courage for their pioneering
in the fact that every night they heard
the howls of the coyote pack ahead.</p>

<p>The game herds were milling restlessly
in high basins. The blacktail bucks had
short new coats of sleek blue-gray; they had
shed the long hair of the previous season,&mdash;the
season of short blue, the Short Blue Moon
of the Northwest Indian tribes. Broad vistas
of the low country showed through revealing
gaps in the hills, marked by the blue-gray
tinge of the sage; a pale haze hung in the
hills and turned distant green spruce slopes
to silvery blue; the rivers had long since
passed the flood tide of melting drifts, and
were cleared of the roily effects of late summer
rains, and lakes and streams, now free of
sediment, showed blue-green to their very
depths; the high peaks were held in silhouette
against a clear blue sky. Everything showed
a touch of blue,&mdash;such is the Short Blue Moon.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">186</a></span></p>

<p>And the love-making time of the antlered
tribes is ushered in with the season of short
blue. As Breed moved north the whistling
snorts of lovelorn bucks reached his ears day
after day. The clarion bugles of challenging
bulls was promise of meat in plenty. Bighorn
rams squired their bands of ewes on the
plateaus and pinnacles above timber line.</p>

<p>Breed's course was by no means a straight
line. Hunts drew him to the east and west
and frequently back to the south, but the
general trend of it all was a northward migration
for the coyote pack. Some days
they gained twenty miles, some but three or
four, and on others they lost ground. At
the end of a month the land of the Yellowstone
was a hundred miles southeast.</p>

<p>The big gray wolves were more plentiful
here, but scattered and not traveling in packs.
At every wolf howl Breed felt the old hatred
of Flatear surge up in him, but though he
frequently met wolves none of them proved<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">187</a></span>
to be his enemy. The big grays showed
only a casual interest in coyotes, evidencing
neither enmity nor delight at any chance
meeting, indifference the keynote of their
attitude.</p>

<p>Autumn blended into early winter and the
gain toward the north was less apparent,
Breed lingering in the vicinity of good hunting
grounds as he found them, moving on
when the supply of meat diminished. He
held to the main divide of the Rockies, and
when the heavy storms of midwinter set in,
he was well across Montana and nearing the
Canadian line. The deep snowfall had driven
the game down out of the peaks to the lower
valleys of the hills and Breed was forced to
follow. He moved westward across the South
Fork of the Flathead to the Kootenai Range.
There were fewer elk here than in the Yellowstone,
living in scattered bunches and not
congregating in droves of hundreds on the
winter feed grounds. Deer ranged the Kootenai<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">188</a></span>
country in plentiful numbers and Breed
elected to stay. Mating was close at hand
and the northward movement halted.</p>

<p>Stray coyotes drifted continually up from
the south and joined the ranks of the pack,
and there were stray wolves crossing the
range from the Flathead to Swan River and
back. Many of these mated with the unattached
coyotes as they straggled north.
Breed's pack was rapidly thinned down,
pairs dropping out to den till at last only Peg
and Fluff were left.</p>

<p>When the chinook set in Fluff chose a den
site and stopped. Breed held on for another
five miles, then Shady refused to travel. She
picked her own site and showed a keener interest
in home building than she had the
season past, working short shifts to relay
Breed on the digging, and the three tunnels
that led to this new nest hole were longer
and more elaborately curved and twisted
than those of the old den on the Yellowstone.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">189</a></span>
The last day of February seven pups came to
share the den with Shady.</p>

<p>The rest of the pack had denned to the
south and few encroached on Breed's hunting
territory. Deer were still plentiful, even
after a winter of hard hunting, and he found
little difficulty in supplying meat. There
was but one flaw in his contentment.</p>

<p>One day when the pups were a month old
and had recently been out for their first romp
Breed hunted across the divide and down the
western slope of the Kootenais. He stood
on a ridge in the gathering dusk when he was
suddenly aware that other hunters were
abroad before him. His eye caught flashes
of white through the green of the spruce on the
opposite slope. He knew that a band of deer
had been startled to sudden flight, that the
jerky gleams of white were the brief exposures
of the underparts of their tails as they were
upflung in hurdling windfalls. The wind
was wrong and Breed could not catch the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">190</a></span>
scent. He traced their course through the
timber by their white flags and saw three
deer break cover and start out across a long
narrow opening on the slope, the path of
a snowslide that had stripped a lane through
the trees on the steep side hill, its trail a clean
split in the solid green of the spruce. In the
center of the slide the lead deer suddenly
collapsed and the sharp report of a rifle rolled
across the hills.</p>

<p>At the sound of the shot Breed heard a few
deep-chested dog notes half a mile down the
narrow valley. He looked that way and saw
a slender tongue of smoke curling lazily above
the trees around a bend. The deep note was
strange to him, but again the association of
ideas came to his aid. Shady's occasional
fits of barking and her strange ways; the
wolf hounds that had belonged to men and
had chased him in Sand Coulee Basin; this
note that rose in answer to a rifle shot and
came from near the smoke that denoted a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">191</a></span>
cabin. Breed himself was unconscious of
assorting these ideas, but he knew that the
hoarse note came from some dog beast that
belonged to man.</p>

   <p class="caption">Breed was compelled to hunt farther from home as the deer quit the valleys. <i><a href='#Page_191'>Page 191</a>.</i></p>
</div>

<p>A lone prospector had built his cabin on
the west slope of the Kootenais, and hereafter
Breed avoided this vicinity.</p>

<p>When the pups were six weeks old Shady
felt the call to help Breed rustle food and she
hunted by herself in the neighborhood of the
den, but her earnest efforts were unavailing,
as there was no small game and she was
unable to stalk a deer.</p>

<p>Breed was compelled to hunt farther from
home as the deer quit the valleys to descend
to the foothills for the first nips of green grass.
One morning, when far south of the den,
he heard again the note of the hound. It rose
and fell, an eager bellow that moved slowly
through the hills, and Breed did not like the
music. This same baying reached him on
three other days. The reason for all this<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">192</a></span>
uproar was beyond his comprehension, but
from the fact that it came from a dog he knew
that it meant no good for the wild things.</p>

<p>A few days after he first heard this strange
sound he came face to face with a pair of
coyotes that had run with his pack. Their
air was one of dejection and there was no
springiness in their gait. From their dispirited
manner Breed knew that tragedy
had overtaken his friends, that some calamity
had befallen their pups. Later he met a
second pair, a dog coyote and a she-wolf,
and they too were traveling aimlessly, their
family torn from them. But Breed had no
way of linking these disasters with the music
of the trail hound. The prospector kept
a single hound and when he found a fresh
wolf kill in the spring he put the dog on the
tracks that led from it, keeping him in leash,
and the hound led him to the den. He had
found good hunting near his cabin this spring,
as the hills were full of the dens of the small<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">193</a></span>
yellow wolves that had turned up in such
numbers the preceding winter, but his activities
so far had been confined to the country
that lay south of Breed's range.</p>

<p>Breed led the pups forth for a few short
trips as their strength increased. In his
hunts toward the south he frequently crossed
the trails of other coyotes that had led their
offspring out for a ramble. At least one
out of every three families were breeds, and
the pups were uniform. They were heavier
than coyotes and their backstrips were dark;
but their language was pure coyote, their
voices perhaps slightly deeper and with fuller
volume, but the change was so slight as to
escape detection from the ears of man. These
pups were the same sort of hybrids as Breed,
their parental strains identical, yet among
them all he found only one with his own
qualities, the coyote fur and the voice of the
wolf. In all others this was reversed.</p>

<p>Breed's own pups grew strong and active,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">194</a></span>
capable of covering ten miles of rough hill
country in a single night, and the family
would soon have left the den but that Shady
indulged in one of her flighty streaks,&mdash;a
streak prompted by the dog strain in her
rising temporarily above the wild.</p>

<p>She had hunted tirelessly but had failed
to bring home a scrap of meat. Her hopes
ran high and she ranged continually farther
from the den till she eventually crossed over
the divide for a look at the west slope. The
breeze held steadily from the west and Shady
caught a whiff of wood smoke and moved
toward it to investigate. She scouted along
the edge of the timber, watching the cabin
in the little clearing for signs of life. It
appeared deserted. She crossed to it and
sniffed at a crack,&mdash;then fled for her life.
At the first sniff there came a deafening bellow
and a great hound surged round the corner
of the house.</p>

<p>As Shady fled she rolled her eyes back,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">195</a></span>
coyote fashion, for a glimpse behind. She
noted that the hound seemed to have trouble
in getting started, and once back in the
timber she stopped. She heard the rattle of
a chain,&mdash;the hound was anchored! From
long experience in the past Shady knew the
futility of striving to break a chain. The
dog was powerless to harm her. Even if he
should free himself it would avail him nothing;
these slow running hounds were known to her,
and their speed was no match for her own.</p>

<p>Shady returned to the cabin and peered
round one corner at the raging hound whose
six-foot chain prevented his clearing the next
corner by more than a foot. She moved along
the side of the house till within ten feet of
him and sat down, her tongue lolling out
contentedly as she watched the frenzied
hound almost strangle himself in his efforts
to reach her.</p>

<p>A flutter of canvas caught her eye and she
rose with her forefeet against the logs as she<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">196</a></span>
stretched her nose up toward it. The prospector
had rolled the cloth round a ten-pound
piece of fresh venison to keep the flies from
it. Shady sprang and seized it, swinging
clear of the ground, all four feet braced against
the logs, then fell sprawling as the nail from
which it was suspended bent and allowed the
cord to slip. She started off across the open,
and the first fold of canvas flapped loosely
under her feet and tripped her. Halfway
to the timber the meat dropped out and she
took it, leaving the cloth behind; something
over an hour later she turned up at the den
with the first meat she had ever furnished for
her own pups.</p>

<p>The prospector returned to his cabin and
while still a mile away he heard the bellowing
of the dog. The first sight that greeted him
was the canvas, flapping limply in the open,
and he found Shady's dust tracks round the
cabin, and swore. He ducked hurriedly into
the house and reappeared with a shotgun,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">197</a></span>
unsnapped the chain from the cabin wall
and resnapped it in his belt, and he was off,
with the eager hound tugging ahead of him
on Shady's trail.</p>

<p>Shady, elated by her first success, had left
the den for another hunt. As she swung back
toward home she heard the steady bellow of
a hound and put on full speed ahead. The
baying ceased except for an occasional bark,
and when Shady came to the last fringe of
trees along the ridge she saw a man standing
at the den. The hound was chained to a
single tree some thirty yards away and she
knew there was naught to fear from him.
The man started excavating with a light
miner's pick and a short-handled shovel
which he unslung from his back. In half an
hour he had opened one tunnel till he could
peer into the den hole. Then he unwound
a strange instrument from about his waist,
a wolfer's "feeler", three strands of wire
twisted into a pliable cable ten feet long, the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">198</a></span>
three ends of the strands extending forklike
a bare two inches beyond the cable braid at
one end. This simple invention eliminates
much tedious excavation work, the sensitive
tool following the curves of the branching
tunnels which each wolf pup makes for himself
as soon as he is able to dig. Shady
prowled along the edge of the timber and
viewed these preparations suspiciously.</p>

<p>The man inserted the end of the feeler in
a hole that led off the main cavity of the den,
and advanced it by gentle thrusts, twisting
it as he pushed to clear the forks. There
was not a sound from the den. The feeler
would go no farther. He grasped it flat
between the palms of his hands and twirled
the cable rapidly from right to left. There
was a sudden spitting explosion of baby
snarls from the depths of the hole. The
man gave one tentative tug and felt resistance,
then hauled the feeler in hand over hand
and drew forth a fighting pup, the three tines<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">199</a></span>
twisted firmly into his soft fur. The hound
opened up excitedly; the short pick swept
up and down,&mdash;and the pup was a lifeless
heap.</p>

<p>Terror and rage flooded Shady in equal
parts. She gave one sharp cry,&mdash;and the
other two openings disgorged a shower of
frightened pups that scattered toward the
timber as so many flushed partridges, fleeing
in response to their mother's sharp command,
and Shady raged straight at the
man!</p>

<p>The prospector was an old hand at rifling
wolf dens. Occasionally a pup would dart
from another exit, and the shotgun was an
effective weapon with which to check his
flight. But never had he seen such a mad
outpouring of pups as this, and in all his long
life in the hills a she-wolf had never rushed
him, even in defense of her pups. Shady's
charge was reversed so suddenly as to appear
that she turned a flip in mid-air when she saw<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">200</a></span>
the man's hand stretch forth and lift the
shotgun from the ground, for she knew well
its purpose and its power.</p>

<p>The thunderous roar of black powder
sounded behind her and a charge of heavy
shot raked her hips and loins as she gained
the trees. Shot pierced both ears and furrowed
along her skull. The man turned and
pulled the second barrel at the rearmost pup
and he went down limply, a puff of fur flung
into the air above him, his life snuffed out
in a single instant as the heavy charge pulverized
him from end to end.</p>

<p>A piercing series of yelps issued from the
timber as Shady gave voice to her agony.
The prospector nodded. The mystery was
cleared; for he knew that he might shoot
a wolf or coyote to mincemeat and neither
would make a sound.</p>

<p>"A dog," he said. "A renegade. I should
have knowed it all along; her stealing thataway
right alongside of Buge; and her<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">201</a></span>
bristling up to me&mdash;no wolf would carry on
like that."</p>

<p>He strode to the tree and unleashed the
hound.</p>

<p>"Go to it, Buge!" he said. "Go clean up
them pups."</p>

<p>As the dog sped into the timber a sharp
note sounded from far down the slope. Shady
had partially recovered her upset faculties
and called the pups, and they gathered swiftly
to her and ran their best. Even in her
crippled state Shady could have outrun the
trail hound, for her wounds had not yet had
time to stiffen, but the pups could scarcely
hold their own, and the dog's endurance was
far greater.</p>

<p>Breed was returning to the den with a
ragged chunk of venison when he heard the
double roar of the gun and Shady's agonized
yelps. Her later cry to gather the pups indicated
the general direction of her flight.
Then the steady tonguing of the hound broke<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">202</a></span>
forth. Breed flanked the dog's route till
he drew abreast of him. The baying voice
filled the valley and echoed among the rims
till it seemed that the whole breadth of the
hills was filled with dogs, but Breed knew
that the sound came from but one. He could
hear no sounds of man, and he dropped swiftly
in behind Buge to decipher the signs of the
trail. There were the hot tracks of Shady
and the pups, the hound's tracks on top of
theirs, and no man had come that way.
Breed spurted ahead and sighted the dog,
and swung out to flank him and get the wind.</p>

<p>Buge ran with his nose close to the ground.
He was gaining on his prey, and his mind
was so wholly centered on the trail that he
was unaware of the deadly yellow wolf that
ran almost abreast of him and forty yards
downwind. Breed was puzzled as to how to
handle the situation that confronted him.
He feared the hound, believing that an ally
of man might be endowed with man's strange<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">203</a></span>
power for harm. The dog was a slow,
cumbersome animal and Breed knew that
Shady was far speedier, yet he wished the
spotted beast would quit her trail. He saw
Buge's nose lifted from the trail as he caught
the warm body scent from close at hand.
The dog ran now with head held high, the
body scent reeking in his nostrils. Then
Breed saw Shady and the pups running under
the trees a hundred yards ahead. The steady
baying rose to a slobbering bellow as the
hound followed his prey by sight. The gap
narrowed, and Breed could see his slavering
jaws, the froth drooling stringily back across
his shoulders. The last pup was running
desperately a bare twenty yards ahead,&mdash;and
then the great hound was suddenly
thrown off his feet as a fighting yellow devil
struck him from the side without a sound to
announce his rush. Breed's shoulder had
caught him fairly in the middle of a stride
and the shock of the impact slammed him<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">204</a></span>
down six feet away; as Buge landed heavily
on his side two flashing rows of teeth closed
on his throat and sliced into it, and his life
was torn out with the yellow wolf's backward
wrench.</p>

<p>Then Breed ran on after Shady and the
pups, knowing now that a single short-haired
dog, despite the terrifying volume of his voice,
was no formidable antagonist for a wolf when
once caught outside the radius of man's
protection.</p>

<p>Night settled down over the hills as Breed
came to the end of Shady's trail and found her
lying in a half-swoon with the pups crouching
near. Breed felt that he was leaving this
country to return no more, and almost unconsciously
he raised the call for the pack,
knowing that the pack season was far in the
future, yet longing to hear the voices of his
friends. Far to the south a pair of coyote
voices answered him, and still beyond them,
so far that the sound did not reach Breed's<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">205</a></span>
ears, a second pair of coyotes relayed the
message that the yellow leader called.</p>

<p>Breed urged Shady on, but in three miles
the wolf family was forced to lay over for
a rest. Here a pair of coyotes overtook
them. The slow march was resumed with
frequent halts for rest, and before morning two
other pairs of coyotes caught up with them,
and these were all members of the original
pack that had hunted together in Sand Coulee
Basin. Just at dawn the dog coyote Breed
had met some time earlier in the spring
brought his she-wolf mate and joined the
band. All of the new arrivals had lost their
pups through the efforts of the hound that
Breed had slain, and they were free to follow
where the leader willed.</p>

<p>Breed moved east across the Flathead and
for two days he urged Shady on relentlessly
till they were far up the sheltering slopes of
the main divide. Shady then took shelter
in a windfall, and for the next three days she<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">206</a></span>
refused to move. Her wounds stiffened and
festered from imbedded shot, and she was
dry and feverish. Three stray coyotes crossed
the Flathead and joined those that prowled
within a few miles of Shady's retreat.</p>

<p>The third night Breed heard a well-known
voice far down the slope and he threw all
the force of his lungs into a welcoming cry.</p>

<p>A coyote invariably deserts a den that is
neared by man. Peg had discovered Breed's
rifled den and his keen nose interpreted the
signs. He had heard the leader's call and
wondered why it had been raised so early
in the year. He followed the sign till he
found the body of the hound. It was morning
when he reached his own home, and the
following night Peg and Fluff had led their
pups off in the general direction taken by
Breed. The trail had cooled, but in moist
and sheltered spots he found sufficient trace
to guide him, and in the heavy timber where
the great drifts lingered he could follow it<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">207</a></span>
by sight. Then at last he heard Breed's
voice above him and an hour later Peg and
Fluff led six half-grown pups to the windfall.</p>

<p>When Shady was once more able to travel
Breed led the way to the north, the band
not traveling together, but every coyote's
course laid out to accord with Breed's, and
within hailing distance so that each might
apprise the others of his whereabouts at
night. When the pups were old enough to
shift for themselves Breed had crossed the
Canadian line and was two hundred miles
north of it along the great divide that marks
the boundary between British Columbia and
Alberta.</p>

<p>All along this route clear from the Yellowstone
there had been coyote country to the
east of him. The prairie wolves had long
since populated the valleys of the Musselshell,
and, farther north, the Marias River
and the Breast. There were coyotes east
of him now, running the prairies of Alberta<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">208</a></span>
and Saskatchewan, but he had at last arrived
at a point west of the extreme northern
limits of the coyote range. All over the
continent to the south and east of him pioneering
coyotes were pushing on into new
lands: they had penetrated the hill country
of Pennsylvania to the east, and south almost
to Panama; but it had fallen to the lot of
the yellow wolf to lead the way for the horde
that was invading the northwest hills.</p>

<p>During the first storm of the early fall
Breed pulled down a yearling mountain
sheep on a high plateau. A motley crew
answered the meat call. Breed, the yellow
hybrid, Shady, the half-blood renegade, and
four pairs of coyotes born in Sand Coulee
Basin; the dog coyote with his timber-wolf
mate and several of Breed's and Shady's
conglomerate pups; all were there to feed.
And when the bones were picked Breed led
his nondescript band on into the unmapped
wilds of the British Columbia hills.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XI" id="CHAPTER_XI"></a>CHAPTER XI</h2>


<p>Wolfing was no longer profitable in the
foothills and Collins pulled up stakes and left.
He loaded his belongings on his pack horses
and journeyed far to the north. Later he
sold his horses and traveled by canoe, and
after a roundabout course he pre&euml;mpted an
old cabin between the Laird Fork of the
Mackenzie and the head of Peace River.
The climate was moist and the underbrush
growth was often so dense as to force him to
hack out a trail in spots as he laid out his
trap line. The side hills were matted tangles
and the valleys shaking bogs, and Collins had
little love for his new surroundings. There
were no cheery sounds at night, only the howls
of wolves. In midwinter of his first season
in the north he was roused out of a sound<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">210</a></span>
sleep, certain that somewhere close at hand
a coyote had howled. During the brief gray
light of the following day Collins stopped
and gazed long at a small, wolf-like track in
the snow.</p>

<p>"Coyote!" he announced triumphantly.
"It was him that howled."</p>

<p>Twenty yards farther on he crossed a
second coyote track, and for half a mile there
were trails pointing to the north. There
was one that showed evidence of a missing
foot, a peg-leg such as those he had often
seen on the open range. Then Collins halted
and studied the next two trails that appeared
side by side. One was a wolf track, and there
were two toes missing from one hind foot.
The smaller tracks were evenly spaced, and
placed one before the other in a straight line
after the manner of coyote and wolf, but ten
feet beyond where Collins stood the trail
showed the wavering gait of the dog with
an occasional track out to either side. A<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">211</a></span>
sudden mist blurred Collins' eyes and he
dashed it off with the back of his mitts.</p>

<p>"It's Shady," he said. "Old Shady and
that yellow Breed,&mdash;both still alive and
way off up here." Collins threw back his
head and sent forth the clear piercing whistle
that he had used to summon Shady in the
long ago. Three times the shrill blast, long
and sustained, was sent far out across the
snowy hills.</p>

<p>Three miles to the north Shady lay curled
up with Breed. She suddenly raised her
head. Breed too opened his eyes and cocked
one ear to listen. Shady was conscious of
no actual sound. Some faint vibration
reached her ears and seemed to play upon
some chord deep within; the impressions
were hazy and indistinct, yet she was aware
of a vague sense of loss, a wave of something
akin to homesickness, and she whimpered
softly, then closed her eyes and slept.</p>

<p>Collins heard more and more coyotes howl,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">212</a></span>
and in the next two months he had brief
glimpses of perhaps a dozen as they moved
across some opening. At least half of these
seemed larger than the coyotes he had known,
and they had dark fur on their backs. The
Coyote Prophet studied long over these strange
things. The coyote voices roused an ache
for the homely cabin in Sand Coulee Basin
a thousand miles to the south; and each
time one howled he said:</p>

<p>"I'm going back. Once it comes spring
I'll make tracks out of here. This here's
no fit country for a white man, and me&mdash;I'm
going back."</p>

<p>But Collins did not go back with the opening
up of spring. Rumors of a gold strike
sent men stampeding toward the fabled spot,
a long journey to the north and east. Three
parties crossed over the old trail past Collins'
shack. The old wolfer caught the fever and
followed the last of them. Before he left
he made one last prophecy.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">213</a></span></p>

<p>He predicted that the hill coyotes of the
northwest from the Yukon to the Yellowstone
would be larger and have dark fur on their
backs from frequent infusions of wolf blood;
that within a dozen years the fur markets
would distinguish between these dark silky-furred
ones and the woolly yellow coyotes
of the plains. He scrawled this message on
a wrinkled scrap of paper, signed it, tacked
it on the wall, and started off down the trail.</p>

<p>A month later a party of five men stopped
overnight in the deserted cabin. One of
them deciphered the queer scrawl.</p>

<p>"Crazy," he announced. "Some old coot
went off his nut from being holed up alone&mdash;and
this is all he left."</p>

<p>A tall lean man whose warped legs betrayed
his sage-country origin leaned over and studied
the signature.</p>

<p>"Collins," he mused. "Now whoever
would have figured to cut his trail up here?
He maybe was crazy,&mdash;but anyway, I'll<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">214</a></span>
bet five hundred that scrap of paper will
pan out just like it says."</p>

<p>A hundred miles beyond the cabin Breed
and Shady were educating their third litter
of pups. The nature of the country had
prevented the excavating of a proper den and
Shady had taken possession of a windfall.
Breed was vastly disgusted with this new
land, heartily sick of being shut in by the
interminable hills and of traveling through
swampy jungles of tall brush, and he was
glad when the pups were old enough to shift
for themselves.</p>

<p>He gathered the pack and started on, his
course this time more east than north, and
he covered better than twenty miles each
day with a definite purpose of leaving behind
him this country so thickly overlaid with
brush that its effect upon him was almost
a feeling of suffocation. He came out into
the lower hills and crossed occasional open
spots. Then, after ten days, he crossed<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">215</a></span>
through a rolling country and just at dusk
came out on the shoulder of a hill; before
him lay broad stretches of low plains, open
meadows alternating with strips of heavy
timber, the whole a wonderful park-like landscape
swimming in the twilight. From nearby
hills he heard the coyotes beginning to
tune up, and each one was facing toward the
plains, the first spot they had seen in three
years which reminded them of home. Breed
led the way and brought his band out into
the first reaches of the Mackenzie Barrens
that stretched back among the trees.</p>

<p>Breed found no trap lines here, and there
were no mad coyotes or poison baits. Another
two days and the trees were left behind,
open country stretching ahead as far as his
eye could reach; the brush was stunted and
reminded him of sage; there were clumps
of dwarf spruce much like the twisted cedars
of the badland brakes, and thickets of stunted
willows such as those that sprouted from every<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">216</a></span>
side-hill spring in Sand Coulee Basin. It was
like a <a name="homecoming" id="homecoming">homecoming</a> after being exiled for
three long years,&mdash;and Breed was content
at last as he bedded on a knoll. The range
was once more dotted with stock&mdash;only
these were wild caribou&mdash;and old habits
cropped out in Breed; he knew there were no
men here, yet all through the short two-hour
day he frequently raised his head and his
eyes swept the range for signs of the devilish
riders. When he left his bed he found fresh
evidence that he was home, that Sand Coulee
Basin could not be farther away than over
the next tongue of high ground; for he had
not traveled a mile before he smelled coyote
blood and traced it upwind to find an old
friend stiffened in death, and with her throat
slit open,&mdash;the work of the silent assassin
that had terrorized the foothills of Hardpan
Spur.</p>

<p>Breed's hatred of Flatear had been dulled
with time. He had met hundreds of wolves<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">217</a></span>
since the fight in the notch, and at first he
had sought for his enemy, but later this
search had been manifested only by a careful
investigation of each new wolf he met, a
vague suspicion that the big gray might be
an enemy; but this had become almost a
mechanical process rather than a distinct
impression of why he should expect to find
an enemy among wolves.</p>

<p>Animal memories are a mixture of impressions
received through the senses of
hearing, sight and smell, and after a considerable
lapse of time it requires the coordination
of all three of these senses to
reconstruct the thought in its entirety. The
sight of the slain coyote filled Breed with
rage but lacking a definite object upon which
to vent it. The scent around the spot further
enraged him, and the picture of the great
gray beast swam nebulously in his mind.
A wolf howl sounded close at hand and stirred
still another long-dormant pool of impressions;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">218</a></span>
the whole crystallized into a distinct
likeness of Flatear,&mdash;and Breed was off on
the hunt for his ancient enemy.</p>

<p>Flatear saw a great yellow wolf rushing
down on him and he whirled and bared his
teeth. The gray wolf weighed a hundred
pounds, Breed slightly over ninety. They
circled cautiously for an opening, hind parts
tensed and drooping, ears laid flat and lips
drawn back to expose the yellow tusks.
Flatear sprang first and Breed met the open
mouth with his own. The clash of teeth
sounded far across the barrens and silent
shapes changed their direction and moved
toward the sound. Three times Breed took
the force of the drive on his teeth and the
jaws of both wolves dripped blood. A wolf
came slipping up to watch, and two breeds of
the yellow wolf's pack stationed themselves
ten yards away. Three more wolves appeared;
then Peg and Fluff came to the scene
and Peg moved behind Flatear and crouched.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">219</a></span></p>

<p>Breed's snarl warned him off. The three-legged
coyote was old and hoary, in his
fifteenth year and with but a short span of
life ahead; his teeth were rounded and worn
down but his spirit was stout, and he longed
to mix it with the wolf. His leader's order
held him back, but he remained the nearest
of the lot, watching every move of the combat
as if appointed judge of it.</p>

<p>Flatear rushed time and again, using his
greater weight to batter down his antagonist's
guard, but Breed gave back each time and
Flatear's driving shoulder never reached its
mark and his teeth were met with teeth.
Breed was losing ground and Flatear pressed
him hard. The yellow wolf seemed to have
but one style of defense and no heart for
attack. The fight was a mere procession
of retreats before Flatear's heavy drives, and
the gray wolf grew accustomed to this monotonous
defense, and his attacks were unconsciously
conformed to it, becoming equally<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">220</a></span>
mechanical, his one purpose to wear his enemy
down by sheer strength and weight.</p>

<p>And when Breed, instead of cringing away,
struck at him with every ounce of his ninety
pounds, Flatear was unprepared. He had
started his spring and Breed's counter drive
was aimed so low that his chest skimmed the
ground. Flatear slashed savagely downward
but the yellow wolf's head was well under
him, and even as Flatear's teeth grazed
Breed's shoulder his forward sweep was
checked in mid-air as powerful jaws closed on
a foreleg with a sickening crunch of bones.
The opposing weights of both wolves pivoted
on that one leg, and in addition to the fracture
Flatear's whole side and shoulder were
wrenched clear to his spine.</p>

<p>There was an uneasy movement among
the spectators, now numbering more than a
score, wolves and coyotes for the first time in
history mingling to witness the settling of
a personal feud. Peg now sat down contentedly,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">221</a></span>
his tongue lolling out in a satisfied
grin.</p>

<p>Breed's tactics changed and he wheeled
round his disabled enemy with lightning
feints; then his shoulder struck Flatear
with a solid smash that crumpled him and
he went down with Breed's teeth at his windpipe.
His end was of the sort which he himself
had handed to so many others,&mdash;and
the new range was safe for coyotes.</p>

<p>The silent spectators were startled by a
faint whining sound. This whimpering grew
louder and the wolves slunk away but the
coyote pack remained. Breed's sudden hunt
for Flatear had caught Shady unprepared,
but she had finally cut his trail and was following
it to the spot.</p>

<p>For three months Breed saw no more of
wolves, and when next he did see them the
beasts were white. He had led the pack
to the basin of the Copper River at the edge
of the Arctic Circle. Their travels were over,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">222</a></span>
and they now ranged a limited area of less
than a hundred miles in extent. Except
that no high hills flanked their new home,
its features were much like the old. There
were no longer any days and nights, but a
seemingly endless period of varying degrees
of twilight, and the rolling hills were deep
with snow.</p>

<p>Breed had met many new animals since
leaving the land of the Yellowstone; he had
known moose and goats in British Columbia,
caribou on the barrens and the iron-gray
sheep at the head of the Nelson. Now there
were strange shaggy beasts with hair that
hung nearly to the ground, and they came
out of the north in small droves, the white
wolves traveling on the flanks of the herds.
He found musk ox easy prey and there was no
lack of meat.</p>

<p>A few days after the first of these appeared
Breed and Shady topped a ridge and saw the
one thing necessary to make the image of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">223</a></span>
old home complete. A light twinkled some
half a mile away, as Breed and Shady had so
often seen the lights of Collins' cabin. Shady
whined as she looked at it and Breed raised
his voice and howled. As if in answer to the
howl a shrill whistle floated to them and
Shady at once slipped from Breed's side and
headed for the fire.</p>

<p>Collins had turned back from the fabled
gold fields, heartsick for the sight of his
native foothills, disgusted with the Arctic
night and a flat white world, and with two
companions he had braved the terrors of a
winter journey and headed into the south.
They traveled light, supplies for three packed
on a single sled, drawn by six dogs. Food
had run low and for a week they had been
forced to subsist on starvation rations; one
more day and they would have killed a dog,&mdash;and
then they crossed the trail of a musk
ox herd. There was now food in plenty but
Collins' mental exhaustion did not vanish<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">224</a></span>
with returning physical strength. He was
obsessed with the idea that he would never
see the sagebrush hills again and his companions
could not rouse him.</p>

<p>They fastened the dogs in a clump of
dwarfed spruce and built a small fire on the
downwind side of the trees.</p>

<p>The old wolfer sat huddled in his furs
before the fire, dreading to enter the little
tent to crawl into his sleeping bag alone with
his thoughts; for the white madness was
driving its iron into his soul and striking
at his reason. His mind coined queer white
couplets; the white wolf pack and the white
ice pack,&mdash;a whole world shrouded in white
night.</p>

<p>His companions had looked upon the white
madness before; had seen men die from
the deadly monotony of it all. It was conceivable
that a book of bright pictures, anything
with warm colors might penetrate the
pall of white fog that clouded his brain and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">225</a></span>
shatter the obsession, reinstating reason on
its tottering throne. But there was only
the howling of white wolves out across the
white snow fields. Then a wolf howl sounded
from close at hand.</p>

<p>It seemed to pierce Collins' stupor and
strike some memory filed long ago in
his subconscious mind, and he suddenly
straightened and glared at them.</p>

<p>"I can pick him out from amongst a thousand
wolves," he stated. "There's no wolf
shiver to that howl. It's a yellow wolf!
As yellow as gold, not a damned white hair
on him anywheres! It's Breed, the yellow
wolf of Sand Coulee Basin&mdash;there's color
come into this white hell hole at last!"</p>

<p>A shrill whistle pealed from his lips and his
companions shook their heads. Then the
wolf howled again and they stiffened with
surprise as a score of wild voices answered.
The sounds were new to them and the snowy
waste was filled with bewilderingly different<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">226</a></span>
inflections that ripped back and forth through
opposing waves of sound till it seemed that
jeering cachinnations rose from a thousand
fiends.</p>

<p>They read the gleam in Collins' eyes and
his disjointed utterances as a sign of hopeless
madness,&mdash;but in reality it was returning
sanity. A new warmth stole over him, and
the certainty that he would win through.</p>

<p>"Here they come," he said. "The little
yellow devils! They've spread from the
Arctic to the Neck, like I always knowed
they would. There's music a white man can
listen to&mdash;the music of the little yellow
wolves."</p>

<p>Then the two men sat silent and wondered
if they themselves were mad. For the dogs
were snarling and straining at their leashes
in the scrub spruce, and a strange yellow
she-wolf with a strip of dark fur along her
back came creeping toward the fire. Her
eyes regarded the two men suspiciously and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">227</a></span>
one ear tipped toward the dogs beyond. She
slipped up and rested her head on Collins'
knee, enjoyed his friendly voice and rubbing
fingers for a single minute, then vanished in
the night as the yellow breed-wolf called
his pack.</p>
